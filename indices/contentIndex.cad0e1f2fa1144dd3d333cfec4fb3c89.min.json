While the behavioral output -- a pronounced fear response -- may remain stable over time, the underlying neural circuitry is increasingly understood to be dynamic, undergoing extensive reorganization throughout the consolidation process. In parallel, clinical research shows that remote memories of trauma are more difficult to treat than recent memories, suggesting a link between evolution of the memory and treatment-resistance. A well-characterized tool to experimentally induce a traumatic experience and examine re-exposure across time is cued fear conditioning, in which a neutral stimulus predicts an aversive stimulus. This task has been used for decades to understand the circuitry and mechanisms behind fear memory, but recent advances in the scientific toolkit have recently made tangible novel and important questions about the evolving neural dynamics of fear memory. Understanding the evolution of fear memory is central to understanding the process of traumatic memory consolidation and may identify critical timepoints for intervention in the consolidation process.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex, in line with its broad connectivity, coordinates the response of other cortical and subcortical areas during fear behavior. In particular, the prelimbic cortex (PL) coordinates fear expression and does so through different circuitry at different timepoints, favoring cortical areas at remote timepoints. In parallel to the literature on the dynamic role of  PL, another cortical region -- the temporal association cortex (TeA) -- is critical for the recall of remote but not recent fear memory of an auditory cue. Despite reciprocal connectivity between these two areas, and their parallel functional evolutions controlling fear behavior, no research has investigated if, how, and when PL \u003e TeA connectivity controls fear memory.  In the proposed research strategy, I will use projection-specific in-vivo tools to:  1) dissect the causal role of PL\u003eTeA projections in recent and remote cued fear memory via optogenetic manipulations, 2) decode the information in PL\u003eTeA neurons at recent and remote timepoints via calcium imaging, 3) identify critical activity windows for PL\u003eTeA circuit consolidation via chemogenetics.\n\n# Aims\nAim 1: Determine the functional evolution of PL \u003e TeA circuitry in memory recall\n1.1 - Test the necessity and sufficiency of PL \u003e TeA projections in recent cued memory\nHypothesis:  PL\u003eTeA will be neither necessary nor sufficient for recent cued recall\n1.2 - Test the necessity and sufficiency of PL \u003e TeA projections in remote cued memory\nHypothesis: PL\u003eTeA will be both necessary and sufficient for remote recall\n\nAim 2: Determine the computational evolution of PL \u003e TeA neurons in memory recall\n2.1 - Decode the activity of PL\u003eTeA during recent cued recall\nHypothesis: neurons will weakly encode tone\n2.2 - Decode the activity of PL\u003eTeA during remote cued recall\nHypothesis: neurons will encode tone and freezing\n\nAim 3: Determine the activity-dependent timepoints required for evolution of PL\u003eTeA mediating remote recall\n3.1 - Chronically inhibit PL\u003eTeA neurons during early consolidation (1-6d)\nHypothesis:  strong impairment of remote memory\n3.2 - Chronically inhibit PL\u003eTeA neurons during late consolidation (7-13d)\nHypothesis:  weak impairment of remote memory\n\n# Conclusion\nUnderstanding the nature of PL - TeA interaction across fear memory will not only enhance our understanding of the dynamic and complex role of the PFC, but it may also identify a novel pathway for regulation of fear and treatment of traumatic experiences.","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.913868576Z","tags":null},"/.trash/F32/specific-aims-notes/Specific-Aims-brainstorm-and-outline":{"title":"","content":"# Motivation\nTraumatic experiences, such as combat exposure or sexual assault, may generate maladaptive fearful behavior that too often results in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Edsger W. Dijkstra\n\nThis note is devoted to three rules, the following of which is necessary if you want to be successful in scientific research. (If you manage to follow them, they will prove close to sufficient, but that is another story.) They are recorded for the benefit of those who would like to be successful in their scientific research, but fail to be so because, being unaware of these rules, they violate them. In order to avoid any misunderstanding I would like to stress, right in its first paragraph, that this note is purely pragmatic: no moral judgments are implied, and it is completely up to you to decide whether you wish to regard trying to be successful in scientific research as a noble goal in life or not. I even leave you the option of not making that decision at all.\n\nThe first rule is an \"internal\" one: it has nothing to do with your relation with others, it concerns you yourself in isolation. It is as follows:\n\n\u003e \"Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.\"\n\nThis rule tells us that the obviously possible should be shunned as well as the obviously impossible: the first would not be instructive, the second would be hopeless, and both in their own way are barren.\n\nThe second rule is an \"external\" one: it deals with the relation between \"the scientific world\" and \"the real world\". It is as follows:\n\n\u003e \"We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific soundness prevail.\"\n\nThe reason for this rule is obvious. If you do a piece of \"perfect\" work in which no one is interested, no harm is done, on the contrary: at least something \"perfect\"‚Äîbe it irrelevant‚Äîhas been added to our culture. If, however, you offer a shaky, would-be solution to an urgent problem, you do indeed harm to the world which, in view of the urgency of the problem, will only be too willing to apply your ineffective remedy. It is no wonder that charlatanry always flourishes in connection with incurable diseases. (Our second rule is traditionally violated by social sciences to such an extent that one can now question if they deserve the name \"sciences\" at all.)\n\nThe third rule is on the scale \"internal/external\" somewhere in between: it deals with the relation between you and your scientific colleagues. it is as follows:\n\n\u003e \"Never tackle a problem of which you can be pretty sure that (now or in the near future) it will be tackled by others who are, in relation to that problem, at least as competent and well-equipped as you.\"\n\nAgain the reason is obvious. If others will come up with as good a solution as you could obtain, the world doesn't loose a thing if you leave the problem alone. A corollary of the third rule is that one should never compete with one's colleagues. If you are pretty sure that in a certain area you will do a better job than anyone else, please do it in complete devotion, but when in doubt, abstain. The third rule ensures that your contributions --if any!-- will be unique.\n\n---\n\nI have checked the Three Golden Rules with a number of my colleagues from very different parts of the world, living and working under very different circumstances. They all agreed. And were not shocked either. The rules may strike you as a bit cruel... If so, they should, for the sooner you have discovered that the scientific world is not a soft place but --like most other worlds, for that matter-- a fairly ruthless one, the better. My blessings are with you.","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.913868576Z","tags":null},"/advice-and-tips/Understanding-neural-circuits-as-transforming-information-streams":{"title":"","content":"#advice \n\n(inspired by talk from Vikhaas Sohal)\nWhen thinking about a brain circuit, it's not enough to understand what it does to a specific behavior.

In the sensory cortex, activity relayed by the thalamus during a postnatal sensitive period is essential for proper cortical maturation. Whether thalamic activity also shapes prefrontal cortical maturation is unknown. We show that inhibiting the mediodorsal and midline thalamus in mice during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in thalamo‚Äìprefrontal projection density and reduced excitatory drive to prefrontal neurons. It also caused prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits during adulthood associated with disrupted prefrontal cross-correlations and task outcome encoding. Thalamic inhibition during adulthood had no long-lasting consequences. Exciting the thalamus in adulthood during a cognitive task rescued prefrontal cross-correlations, task outcome encoding and cognitive deficits. These data point to adolescence as a sensitive window of thalamocortical circuit maturation. Furthermore, by supporting prefrontal network activity, boosting thalamic activity provides a potential therapeutic strategy for rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n# Key points\nFig 1 - hM4Di in midline thalamus during adolescence (P20 - P50) impairs learning rate on Non-Match to Sample (NMS) task. No effects if inhbition in adult mice.\nFig 2- adolescent midline thalamus inhibition decreases PFC pyramidal neuron activity as adult, ie persistent effects \nFig 3 - adolescent midline thalamus inhibition decreases thalamus-PFC projection density. No effect on BLA-PFC projection density.\nFig 4- used stabilized step function opsin (SSFO) to persistently increase activity in midline thalamus, rescueing deficits on extra dimensional set shifting (EDSS) task\n\nFig 5 - in all animals, (control, hM4D, hM4D + SSFO) PFC gamma power is higher on correct than incorrect trials, though hM4D might have smaller effect size. samples are trials, irrespective of animal. overall suggests changes in gamma do not explain deficit in EDSS.\nFig 5 background - during EDSS task, increase in PFC gamma frequency previously observed during correct trials. Other  oscillations, like PFC beta, also had no manipulation effect (Fig S6a). No difference across manipulations in thalamo-PFC coherence or phase locking (Fig S6c,d,f). Together, shows oscillatory activity cannot explain behavioral deficit.\n\nAuthors previously reported that adolescent inhibition of PFC [[PV]] neurons disrupts adult PFC gamma during task. Because these results do not align, suggests that PFC PV neurons may not be involved in this deficit. \n\nFig 6 - \n\n# Related\n\n\n# Comments\nSubtle but reproduced phenotype.

However, this claim remains controversial because studies involving hippocampal lesions tell us nothing about the contribution of the hippocampus to memory storage if this region was present at the time of memory retrieval. We therefore used non-invasive functional brain imaging using (14C)2-deoxyglucose uptake to examine how the brain circuitry underlying long-term memory storage is reorganized over time in an intact brain. Regional metabolic activity in the brain was mapped in mice tested at different times for retention of a spatial discrimination task. Here we report that increasing the retention interval from 5 days to 25 days resulted in both decreased hippocampal metabolic activity during retention testing and a loss of correlation between hippocampal metabolic activity and memory performance. Concomitantly, a recruitment of certain cortical areas was observed. These results indicate that there is a time-dependent reorganization of the neuronal circuitry underlying long-term memory storage, in which a transitory interaction between the hippocampal formation and the neocortex would mediate the establishment of long-lived cortical memory representations.\n\n# Key points\n\n\n# Related\n[[Dixsaut _ Graff _ 2021 _  Inj J Mol Sci _ The Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Fear Memory - Dynamics, Connectivity, and Engrams]]\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.913868576Z","tags":null},"/articles/Bukalo...Holmes-2021-Beh-Brain-Res.-Effects-of-optogenetic-photoexcitation-of-infralimbic-cortex-inputs-to-the-basolateral-amygdala-on-conditioned-fear-and-extinction":{"title":"","content":"first_author: Bukalo\nlast_author: Holmes\nyear: 2021\njournal: Behavior and Brain Research\n\nmethods: opto, cued fear conditioning, extinction\nspecies: mice\ntags: #fear-memory #extinction #[[PFC]]\n\n\n# Summary\n[[infralimbic]] --\u003e [[basolateral amygdala]] glutamatergic projections known to facilitate extinction.

The article is a Question and Answer session going over how MoSeq works.\n\nIt uses a top down, 3D camera for pose estimation, then a generative computation model to identify behavioral 'modules' to understand the behavioral 'grammar'.\n\nBehavioral modules are unique, single units.

The medial prefrontal cortex, in particular the prelimbic cortex (PL), was traditionally found to be involved in remote memory storage, but recent evidence points toward its implication in early consolidation as well. Nevertheless, the inputs to the PL governing these dynamics remain unknown. Here, we first performed a brain-wide, rabies-based retrograde tracing screen of PL engram cells activated during contextual fear memory formation in male mice to identify relevant PL input regions. Next, we assessed the specific activity pattern of these inputs across different phases of memory consolidation, from fear memory encoding to recent and remote memory recall. Using projection-specific chemogenetic inhibition, we then tested their functional role in memory consolidation, which revealed a hitherto unknown contribution of claus- trum to PL inputs at encoding, and of insular cortex to PL inputs at recent memory recall. Both of these inputs further impacted how PL engram cells were reactivated at memory recall, testifying to their relevance for establishing a memory trace in the PL. Collectively, these data identify a spatio- temporal shift in PL inputs important for early memory consolidation, and thereby help to refine the working model of memory formation.\n\n# Key points\n- PL has major inputs from across [[PFC]], including [[anterior cingulate]], [[prelimbic]], and [[infralimbic]]. \n- Other major inputs:  [[orbitofrontal]], [[insula]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], [[tenia tecta]], [[hippocampus]] CA1, [[claustrum]], [[basolateral amygdala]], [[polymodal association thalamus]] (DORpm), [[dorsal peduncular]]\n- Inhibiting [[basolateral amygdala]]\u003e[[prelimbic]] neurons or [[entorhinal cortex]]\u003e[[prelimbic]] neurons during encoding lead to deficit only at remote memory, not recent memory. Maybe this suggests that silencing specific inputs to PL, but not PL entirely, leads to impaired remote memory expression as the memory shifts to a cortical representation in PL that then \n-  \u003eAt remote memory, did not observe any PL input that was engaged or behaviorally relevant. None have been reported. \"This apparent gap, or the impossibility to trace back the flow of information upstream of the mPFC, could be explained if the inputs are distributed across a vast network after memory consolidation. In that case, they could potentially be redundant and therefore harder to functionally identify. As such, these results are in agreement with the [[multiple trace theory]]\n\n\u003eWe found that the reactivation of PL engram cells significantly correlated with freezing behavior, but only when the CLA and INS inputs were inhibited, and not in controls. When the CLA\u003ePL projection is inhibited at encoding, or when the INS\u003ePLprojectionis inhibited at recent recall, overall engram reactivation is left unchanged, but recent memory expression is impaired, which would suggest that the PL engram population itself is not required for recent memory recall. Since upon inhibition we observe the emergence of acorrelation between PL engram cells reactivation and memory retention, it is possiblethat CLA and INS inputs target inhibitory neurons in the PL, which normally prevent engram reactivation during recent recall, thus allowing the PL engramcellsto stay functionally silent.Releasing this inhibition could perturb normal memory expression, explaining the observed memory impairment at recent recall. Supports the idea of silent engram cells\n\n# Related\n[[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience.

At high density, cofilin binds to actin, resulting in cofilactin which is stable. Inactivating CFL should destabilize cofilactin and 'erase' structural LTP (sLTP). Supernova (SN): a photosensitive protein used for chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI). When illuminated at 559nm, SN generates ROS (reactive oxygen species) that inactivates proteins it is fused to. Time window for CALI to reduce a spine is ~2min after artificually induces LTP (glutamate uncaging) until 30min. Ineffective after 50min. After that timepoint, other processes stabilize the actin that's building out the spine. \n \n FIG 2 Optical erause of memory by CALI is context specific Inhibitory dark avoidance test.

Used PCA to identify multiple (5) clusters of responses to cue (both CS+ and CS-) and reward presentation.

Framed as a push-pull between heterogeneity of population activity vs finding appropriate level of grouping for cells (gene expression, afferent, efferent projection). \n\nThe specific clustering algorithm chosen affected how many clusters were found, between 4 and 5. Noted limitation of clustering algorithms providing only a rough understanding of the possible groupings.\n\nThe cluster with the strongest behavioral correlation, also with the most decoding accuracy, was the cluster with an inhibitory response to CS+ cue onset. This dynamic evolved only in late-learning.\n\nUsing data from late-learning, total population activity could decode all elements of the task. Early-learning data, only some elements. \n\nEnsembles showed within-day and between-day stability of coding.

Although the mechanisms underlying systems consolidation are somewhat known, the factors determining its temporal dynamics are still poorly understood. Here, we studied the influence of novel learning occurring between training and test sessions on the time-course of HPC- and ACC-dependency of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) memory expression. We found that muscimol was disruptive when infused into the HPC up to 35 days after training, while the ACC is vulnerable only after 45 days. However, when animals were subjected to a series of additional, distinct tasks to be learned within the first 3 weeks, muscimol became effective sooner. Muscimol had no effect in the HPC at 20 days after training, exactly when the ACC becomes responsive to this treatment. Thus, our data indicates that the encoding of new information generates a tight interplay between distinct memories, accelerating the reorganization of previously stored long term memories between the hippocampal and cortical areas.\n\n# Key points\n\n\n# Related\n[[Dixsaut _ Graff _ 2021 _  Inj J Mol Sci _ The Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Fear Memory - Dynamics, Connectivity, and Engrams]]\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.913868576Z","tags":null},"/articles/Herry...Luthi-2008-Nature.-Switching-on-and-off-fear-by-distinct-neuronal-circuits":{"title":"","content":"title: Herry...Luthi (2008) Nature.

This complexity of single neuron responses can obscure what information these areas represent and how it is represented. Here we demonstrate the advantages of a new dimensionality reduction technique, demixed principal component analysis (dPCA), that decomposes population activity into a few components. In addition to systematically capturing the majority of the variance of the data, dPCA also exposes the dependence of the neural representation on task parameters such as stimuli, decisions, or rewards. To illustrate our method we reanalyze population data from four datasets comprising different species, different cortical areas and different experimental tasks. In each case, dPCA provides a concise way of visualizing the data that summarizes the taskdependent features of the population response in a single figure.\n![[Pasted image 20220819164134.png]]\n\n# Key points\nPFC neural responses can display ‚Äúbaffling heterogeneity‚Äù. Most neurons display mixed-selectivity.\n\nCurrent dimensionality reduction approaches act without taking task parameters into account. Therefore, the mixed selectivity of cells which respond to multiple task parameters, is still present in the reduced data space.\n\nAuthors created demixed principal component analysis (dPCA). Aims to find a decomposition of the data into latent components that 1) are easily interpretable with respect to task parameters, 2) preserve original data as much as possible (to not throw away anything useful).\n\nCommon existing methods of relating neural activity to task parameter are to use statistical test (ANOVA, ROC Curve). This yields one single population, that can be averaged to get one ‚Äòcomponent‚Äô for each parameter. This is supervised (feed it the parameter).\n\nPCA is an unsupervised approach, capturing more components and more variance. But task parameter info is not taking into account, resulting in mixed components that are hard to interpret with regard to task structure.\n\n‚ÄòDemixing‚Äô finds a decoder (linear discriminator) of the neural activity that separates the different stimuli, ignoring any time-dependency. But LDA does not preserve the ‚Äògeometry‚Äô of the original neurla activity.\n\nCompression aims to find a linear mapping (decoder) that reduces the dimensionality and preserves the original data as much as possible. This is the PCA approach. But fails to separate stimuli.\n\nIn dPCA, changes made to standard PCA approach. Compression and decompression (encoding / decoding) reconstructs not neural activity directly, but neural activity averaged over trials for a parameter.\n\ndPCA output gives PCs but they are labeled with a condition-independent term, a task parameter term, or an interaction of task parameters term. To assess whether tuning was significant, used each component as a linear decoder to classify conditions (stimulus component to classify stimulus).\n\n! For tasks in which trials have different lengths (eg freezing, platform), ‚Äúrestretch‚Äù the activity rates (time-warp) in each trial.\n\n‚ÄúIn both olfactory datasets trials were self-paced. Accordingly, trials last different amounts of time, and firing rates cannot simply be averaged over trials. We used the following time warping (restretching) procedure to equalize the length of all trials and to align several events of interest (Figure 10) separately in each dataset. We defined five alignment events: odor poke in, odor poke out, water poke in, reward delivery, and water poke out. First, we aligned all trials on odor poke in (T1 ¬º 0) and computed median times of the four other events Ti; i ¬º 2 . . . 5 (for the time of reward delivery, we took the median over all correct trials). Second, we set DT to be the minimal waiting time between water port entry and reward delivery across the whole experiment (DT ¬º 0:2 s for the olfactory discrimination task and DT ¬º 0:3 s for the olfactory categorization task). Finally, for each trial with instantaneous firing rate x√∞t√û we set ti; i ¬º 1 . . . 5, to be the times of alignment events on this particular trial (for error trials we took t4 ¬º t3 √æ DT), and stretched x√∞t√û along the time axis in a piecewise-linear manner to align each ti with the corresponding Ti.‚Äù (Kobak et al., 2016, p. 26)\n\nOf note\n\n-   Across all examples, condition-independent components explains the majority (60-90%) of the variance. This could relate overall firing rate changes during certain task periods, but also vary across time, like motor, attentional, breathing states.\n    \n-   dPCA allows component axes to be non-orthogonal (though most tend to be). Non-orthogonality means that neurons expressing one component tended to also express the other one.\n    \n\nLimitations\n\n-   Only works with discrete parameters, and all combinations of parameters must be used as encoders.\n    \n-   Cannot handle missing data.\n    \n-   Needs sufficiently large number of neurons, ~100 for 3 task parameters.\n\n# Related\n\n\n# Comments\n\n\n# Figures","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.913868576Z","tags":null},"/articles/Kwon_Han-2012-Learn-Mem-Brain-region-specific-activity-patterns-after-recent-or-remote-memory-retrieval-of-auditory-conditioned-fear":{"title":"","content":"title: Kwon Han (2012) Learn Mem - Brain region-specific activity patterns after recent or remote memory retrieval of auditory conditioned fear\ntags: #systems-consolidation #remote-memory #recent-memory #cued-fear #TeA \nmethods: auditory fear conditioning, recent and remote recall, IEG histology\n\n# 1 Line\nExpression of IEG zif268 was increased in ventral auditory area / [[temporal association cortex]] during remote (29d) recall of auditory cued fear conditioning, but not recent.\n\n# Abstract\n\n\n# Key points\nzif268 expression was highest  in TeA around -3.7 AP from bregma.\n\n# Related\n[[Sacco and Sacchetti (2010) Science.

Using an olfactory cue-reward association task, showed that lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) fan cells encdoe cue-reward association. DA fibers from [[VTA]] signal novelty (new odor) and eventually shift to reward-prediction (signal in familiar odors only when reward is expected).\n# Key points\nFIG 1 Opto inhibition of LEC fan cells (which project to hippocampus) impair associative learning of new novel odors to rules based on previously learned odors, while recall of rules based on previously learned odors is unimpaired. In contrast, opto inhibition of pyramidal cells in the same LEC layer (which only project to cortex, not hippocampus) causes no impairment. Thereofre, LEC fan cells are necessary for associative learning. \n\nFIG 2 Fan cells encdoe specific cue-reward associations. Individual cells have pairing preferences. As a population vector, the PC space of paired odors grows more similar across learning. Fan cell activity was strongest during cue period and decayed over delay and reward periods, implying joint cue and taks information. On pre-learned associations, fan cell activity was sparse and similar or pre-learned odor retrieval, but grew more active with introduction of novel odor associated with reward odor (A), but weakly active with non-rewarded odor (B). \n\nFIG 3 Fiber photometry of VTA\u003eLEC DA fibers. Inhibiting these optogenetically and pharmacologically impaired novel odor association. Fiber photometry results show little signal during AB trials after learning, but large signals when odor 1 and 2 were introduced. Signal for odor 2 eventually faded, but increased for odor A and remained high for odor 1. Data suggest these LED DA fibers initially carry novelty signal, then transition to reward expectation during learning \n\nFIG 4 Used opto-tag to record from LEC fan cells while inhibiting VTA fibers. Unilateral inhibition decreased correct response trials. PC analysis of recordings during control and inhibition trials showed that LEC cells failed to group A-1 odors during inhibition, as happens in controls. Separation of A-B odors in LEC encoding still occurred, pointing to a non-DAergic mechanism. Together, authors argue LEC inputs are required for establishing the representation of cue-reward association in LEC fan cells during associative learning\n\n\n# Related\n[[Elwood...Sohal (2017) J Neuro.

Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning.\n\n# Key points\nUsed FM sweeps as CS+ and CS-.\n\nFIG 1 muscimol inhibition of primary auditory cortex reduces freezing to both CS+ and CS- in fear conditioning paradigm. Using 2P on anesthetized mice, layer 1 inhibitory (GAD67+) neurons show a larger response to foot shock than layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons. Using 2P in combination with patch clamp, found most (75%) interneurons in layer 1 increased activity, while 25% strongly decreased activity following anesthetized footshock. This indicates that the primary auditory cortex is sensitive to footshock in an anesthetized animal, and that there are multiple layer 1 inhibitory neuron population response dynamics. \n\nFIG 2 NBQX (AMPAR antagonist) application to auditory cortex removed the initial response but largely left the population response intact. MEC\u0026MLA (nAChR antagonists) application left initial response intact, but removed the rest of the population response. This indicates that there is an initial activity driven my glutamatergic input, while subsequent activity is driven my acetylcholine. \n\nFIG 3 Layer 2/3 PV+ cells are strongly inhibited by footshock during fear conditioning.

However, little is known about how memories are updated with new information. To study how neuronal ensembles might support memory-updating, we used a hippocampus-dependent spatial reversal task to measure hippocampal ensemble dynamics when mice switched navigational goals. Using Miniscope calcium imaging, we identified neuronal ensembles (co-active neurons) in dorsal CA1 that were spatially tuned and stable across training sessions. When reward locations were moved during a reversal session, a subset of these ensembles decreased their activation strength, correlating with memory-updating. These ‚Äúremodeling‚Äù ensembles were a result of weakly-connected neurons becoming less co-active with their peers. Middle-aged mice were impaired in reversal learning, and the prevalence of their remodeling ensembles correlated with their memory-updating performance. Therefore, we have identified a mechanism where the hippocampus breaks down ensembles to support memory-updating.\n\n\n# Key points\nFIG 1 - No global or rate remapping following relearning of spatial reward maze.\n\nFIG 2 - Co-active neurons form ensembles that contain info about space and behavior.\n\nIdentified ~50 ensembles per session, with around 3% total population membership within each ensemble (if 1000 neurons, around 30 each).

Unspecified how calcium event was calculated.\n\nENSEMBLE GENERATION:\n\n\u003eUsed unsupervised PCA then ICA to generate ensembles. ‚ÄúBinarized calcium activity was smoothed using a 5-bin moving average (~300 ms, slightly larger than a single theta cycle) and z-scored. Using this activity matrix, we performed PCA and compared the eigenvalues of each principal component to a surrogate distribution of eigenvalues, created using activity matrices where all neurons had their activities circularly shuffled relative to each other, repeated 500 times. The number of ensembles (independent components) was the number of principal components that had eigenvalues higher than 99% (p \u003c 0.01) of the eigenvalues from the surrogate distribution. We then use this number as the number of independent components to be extracted with fast-ICA algorithm. Each ensemble (independent component) has a weight vector representing the contribution of each neuron to the ensemble, , and neurons were considered ensemble members if their weight exceeded 2 standard deviations above the mean of that ensemble. We then used the outer product of the weight vector to produce the projection matrix P, which can be used to project neural activity into ensemble activation strength. To compute the activation strength of each ensemble at each temporal bin b, we used the formula: ùëÖùëè = ùëçùëèùëáùëÉùëçùëè Where ùëçùëè is the normalized calcium activity at time bin b, and P is the projection matrix, with the main diagonal set to zero to ensure that calcium activity of a single neuron does not contribute to the ensemble strength Rb. Ensembles were classified as ‚Äúremodeled‚Äù using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test97. For an ensemble to be called a remodeled ensemble, its activation strength needed to have a negative slope across time and p\u003c0.005 after ≈†id√°k correction for multiple comparisons across all ensembles.‚Äù (Mau and Cai, p. 24)\n\nALIGNMENT\n\nAligned cells using CellReg.

To access the functional role of de novo transcription, we injected actinomycin D (ActD: 2.5¬†ng/side) directly into the dorsal hippocampus (HIP) or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), 0 (early consolidation) or 12¬†h (late consolidation) after training. Our results showed that de novo transcription at 0¬†h was required for recent and remote memories. However, 12¬†h was a critical time point to memory persistence. In the dHIP, de novo transcription at 12¬†h post-training differentiated the recent memory from the remote. In the dmPFC, ActD affected memory formation depending on the training intensity (1 or 5US). Specifically, freezing was amplified after 5US conditioning. Furthermore, inhibiting de novo transcription at 12¬†h post-training in the dmPFC rapidly increased c-Fos expression in the amygdala. Altogether, our results indicate that contextual fear memory duration is particularly sensitive to de novo transcription in the dHIP and dmPFC, at a specific time point of late consolidation.\n\n# Key points\n\n\n# Related\n[[Vetere...Frankland (2011) PNAS Spine growth in the anterior cingulate is necessary for the consolidation of contextual fear memory]]\n[[Tang _ Zhuo _ 2005 _ Mol Pain _ Pavlovian Fear Memory Induced by Activation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex]]\n[[Kitamura...Tonegawa (2017) Science.

How this is executed with known cellular mechanisms is unknown. Authors propose a combination of Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms to facilitate highly plastic circuits to interact reliably and predictably with rigid representations. The intereaction of Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms \"self-heals\" the readout. Major novelty is re-interpreting Hebbian plasticity as a player in maintaining associations, not just learning new ones. This allows drift to be tracked using only internally generated signals without the need for error feedback. Also propose how dynamic representations can be tracked over long periods of time if the readout population encodes a stable predictive model of the variables being represented. \n\nArgues that representational drift isn't random and the patterns within drift can be used to create legible readout. The \"topology and course geometry\" (ie PCs?) of drift appears consistent over time, therefore the statistical structure of external variables is preserved without the need for neuron-wise encoding. \n\nUsed modeling to provide evidence for their ideas. \n\nThe self-healing codes of representation have a hierarchy of components: 1) single-cell tuning with redundant tiling of encoded variables (which make population codes robust to small amounts of drift), 2) populations that use their own output as a training signal to update decoding weights, 3) circuit interactions that track evolving population statistics using stable internal models. \n\n\u003e\"The encoding population is free to reconfigure its encoding arbitrarily. However, any change in the code leads to a complementary change in how that code is read out.\"\n\n# Related\n[[Schoonover Fink 2020 Nature Representational drift in primary olfactory cortex]]\n\n[[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience.

However, it is unclear how A1 neural activity changes dynamically in response to these variables during the learning process of associative memory tasks. Therefore, we developed an associative memory task using auditory stimuli in rats. In this task, rats were required to associate tone frequencies (high and low) with a choice of ports (right or left) to obtain a reward. The activity of A1 neurons in the rats during the learning process of the task was recorded. A1 neurons increased their firing rates either when the rats were presented with a high or low tone (frequency-selective cells) before they chose either the left or right port (choice-direction cells), or when they received a reward after choosing either the left or right port (reward-direction cells). Furthermore, the proportion of frequency-selective cells and reward-direction cells increased with task acquisition and reached the maximum level in the last stage of learning. These results suggest that A1 neurons have task- and learning-dependent selectivity toward sensory input and reward when auditory tones and behavioral responses are gradually associated during task training. This selective activity of A1 neurons may facilitate the formation of associations, leading to the consolidation of associative memory.\n\n# Key points\nThese results suggest that A1 neurons have task- and learning-dependent selectivity toward sensory input and reward when auditory tones and behavioral responses are gradually associated during task training.\n\n# Related\n[[Grosso...Sacchetti (2015).

The hippocampus may store a memory index for a unique array of neocortical modules representing each experiential event (22). Direct cortico-cortical connections that are gradually established during consolidation may render the hippocampal index codes for the original memory no longer necessary; alternatively, for certain forms of memory, the mPFC might take over the linking function from the hippocampus by storing a similar, but perhaps more efficient, index code (23). The observed selective activity for context-dependent, crossmodal associations in the mPFC is a critical prerequisite for the mPFC to function as a storage site of memory indices for consolidated memory. The role of the mPFC in the retrieval of consolidated memory may thus parallel the putative role of the hippocampus in retrieving recently formed memories, by completing the intercortical neural pattern from a partial cue.\n\n# Related\n[[Prelimbic cortex is necessary for learned memory recall.]]\n\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.917868583Z","tags":null},"/articles/Tang-_-Zhuo-_-2005-_-Mol-Pain-_-Pavlovian-Fear-Memory-Induced-by-Activation-in-the-Anterior-Cingulate-Cortex":{"title":"","content":"title: Tang _ Zhuo _ 2005 _ Mol Pain _ Pavlovian Fear Memory Induced by Activation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex\ntags: #cued-fear [[PFC]] [[anterior cingulate]] #systems-consolidation \nmethods:\n\n# 1 Line\nPaired electrical stimulation of [[anterior cingulate]] with tone produced freezing upon recent recall (1d, 3d).\n\n# Abstract\n\n\n# Key points\n\n\n# Related\n[[Doyere _ Laroche _ 1993 _ Neuropsychologia _ Long-term potentiation of hippocampal afferents and efferents to prefrontal cortex Implications for associative learning]]\n[[Kitamura...Tonegawa (2017) Science.

We took advantage of previous studies showing that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) negatively regulates spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We found that increasing MEF2-dependent transcription in the aCC during a critical posttraining window (but not at later time points) blocked both the consolidation-associated dendritic spine growth and subsequent memory expression.

Two different phases of learning\n\n\n# Summary\nPiriform encodes odor stimulus identity, sending projections to multiple areas, including OFC and mPFC. OFC transiently learns the valence of representations, but stops encoding valence after a period of time. mPFC stably encodes a CS+ ensemble. OFC valence encoding likely reinforces inputs from piriform to mPFC to form a CS+ ensemble. \nDiscrimination occurs in the mPFC, creating a separate CS- ensemble. Reward prediction error likely mediates the distinction between different stimuli, seperating out CS+ and CS- ensembles.\n\n\"In one model, during pretrain- ing, animals exposed to a single CS+ may learn that odor predicts reward through the emergence of a CS+ representation in the OFC. This CS+ representation in OFC may serve a teach- ing function in the mPFC at the initiation of discrimination learning and reinforce all piriform inputs onto the mPFC. Early in discrimination learning, all odors will therefore activate the mPFC CS+ ensemble and drive generalized licking behavior. When the animals experience odors that are not associated with reward (CS \u0001 ), a negative reward prediction error (RPE) signal may be generated by the failure of these odors to predict reward ( Schultz, 2016 ). This negative RPE signal is then relayed onto the mPFC to drive the formation of a CS \u0001 ensemble in the mPFC, distinct from the CS+ ensemble. In this manner, CS \u0001 odors will activate a distinct population of neurons in the mPFC that signals a negative value.\"\n\n# Related papers\n[[Auditory association cortex (Te2) activity is driven by emotional learning]]\n\n[[Grewe...Schnitzer (2017) Nature.

Then, we combined this procedure with Ô¨Åber photometry in TH-Cre rats to study the activity of VTA dopamine neurons during safety learning. We show that whereas footshock is associated with calcium transients in TH neurons across the VTA, shock omission during safety learning is selectively associated with calcium transients in dopamine neurons in the medial but not lateral VTA. Moreover, the magnitude of medial VTA calcium transients during shock omission accurately predicts the amount of safety that is learned and expressed during summation testing.

In both a classical CFC protocol and an immediate shock protocol, PL neurons were found to be strongly reactivated after recent recall. Moreover, a population of PL neurons encoded context information from encoding to recall, and an additional population specifically encoded the context‚Äìshock association. This significant reactivation of PL neurons linked to a learning event, but not IL neurons, suggested that PL could contain engram cells already at encoding, but the remaining criteria to define engram cells were still to be fulfilled.\n\n# Abstract\n\u003eAlthough the circuit mediating contextual fear conditioning has been extensively described, the precise contribution that specific anatomical nodes make to behavior has not been fully elucidated. To clarify the roles of the dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in contextual fear conditioning, activity within these regions was mapped using cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence¬†_in situ_¬†hybridization (catFISH) for¬†_Arc_¬†mRNA. Rats were delay-fear conditioned or immediately shocked (controls) and thereafter reexposed to the shocked context to test for fear memory recall. Subsequent catFISH analyses revealed that in the DH, cells were preferentially reactivated during the context test, regardless of whether animals had been fear conditioned or immediately shocked, suggesting that the DH encodes spatial information specifically, rather then the emotional valence of an environment. In direct contrast, neuronal ensembles in the BLA were only reactivated at test if animals had been fear conditioned, suggesting that the amygdala specifically tracks the emotional properties of a context. Interestingly,¬†_Arc_¬†expression in the mPFC was consistent with both amygdala- and hippocampus-like patterns, supporting a role for the mPFC in both fear and contextual processing. Collectively, these data provide crucial insight into the region-specific behavior of neuronal ensembles during contextual fear conditioning and demonstrate a dissociable role for the hippocampus and amygdala in processing the contextual and emotional properties of a fear memory.\n\n# Key points\n\n\n# Related\n[[Dixsaut _ Graff _ 2021 _  Inj J Mol Sci _ The Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Fear Memory - Dynamics, Connectivity, and Engrams]]\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.917868583Z","tags":null},"/articles/Zeilowsky-_-Fanselow-_-2014-_-JNeuro-_-Neuronal-Ensembles-in-Amygdala-Hippocampus-and-Prefrontal-Cortex-Track-Differential-Components-of-Contextual-Fear":{"title":"","content":"title: Zeilowsky _ Fanselow _ 2014 _ JNeuro _ Neuronal Ensembles in Amygdala, Hippocampus, and Prefrontal Cortex Track Differential Components of Contextual Fear\ntags: #engram #recent-memory [[PFC]] [[amygdala]] [[hippocampus]] #contextual-fear \nmethods: rats\n\n# 1 Line\nUsing catFISH with Arc mRNA, after contextual fear conditioning and an immediate shock protocol, [[prelimbic]] neurons were strongly reactivated after recent recall.

Monosynaptic tracing with G-deleted rabies (RVdG) involves expression of the EnvA receptor, TVA, and rabies glycoprotein (G) in starter cells. These cells are subsequently infected specifically with EnvA + RVdG, which is trans-complemented by G to produce G + RVdG that spreads trans-synaptically to neurons providing synaptic input to starter cells. The spread of RVdG is monosynaptically restricted because the input cells lack G and G is required for trans-synaptic spread. In this example, the starter cells are selected on the basis of Cre expression in a mouse line expressing Cre in a cell type of interest. In the first step (1) a helper virus that expresses TVA, G, and a marker gene (RFP) in a Cre-dependent manner is injected in the location of desired starter cells. This results in expression of TVA, G, and RFP only in the Cre+ cells (green and red) (2). After a sufficient time for accumulation of TVA and G, EnvA + RVdG is injected in the location (3) and selectively infects the TVA+ starter cells. In this example the EnvA + RVdG contains the coding sequence for GFP resulting in GFP expression in the starter cells. The RVdG replicates in the starter cells and trans-complementation with G results in the production of G + RVdG that spreads trans-synaptically to input cells (4), which express GFP from the RV genome (green). The result is that starter cells are marked with both RFP and GFP while input cells express only GFP. Other neurons that do not express Cre and are not directly presynaptic to starter cells remain unlabeled (light yellow).","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.973868687Z","tags":null},"/misc/PFC":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.973868687Z","tags":null},"/misc/PFC-and-PL-population-encoding-is-diverse-specific-projections-populations-are-more-distinct":{"title":"","content":"At the population level of the [[PFC]] and [[prelimbic]], there is a diverse response.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website.

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first.

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.977868694Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

These data indicate the auditory cortex encodes not only the identity and relevance of tones, but also the presence, content, and expectation of emotional stimuli associated with tones.\n\nLong established that emotionally valenced tones cause changes to auditory cortex, but when only one valence is used, it can't be determined if the changes represent the valence itself (appeitive, aversive) or simply the importance (ie the existence of a valence itself)\n\nAversive stimuli by themselves, without tones, activates auditory cortex and triggers plasticity\n\nAuditory cortex differentially encodes positive and negative valenced emotional stimuli linked to tones (Pi et al 2013, Grosso et al 2015)\n\nevidence for emotional processing not just in temporal association cortex but in primary auditory cortex as well. But association cortex is primarily modulated by emotionally valenced sounds, and required for their recall, whereas primary is only partially\n\nLetzkus 2011 demonstrated that ACh released from basal forebrain mediates the activation of auditory cortical neurons during tones paired with aversive stimuli in primary auditory cortex. Cambiaghi 2016 showed that nicotine administered into auditory association cortex prior to remote recall uniquely DISRUPTED aversive tone recall, but not appetitive tone recall or aversive odor recall. (would have expected the opposite)\n\n#VTA #DA projects to auditory cortex, and VTA stimulation paired with tones enhances cortical representation to that tone (Bao et al, 2001). But unknown if DA links tone identity to an appetitive quality, or if it simply encodes salience regardless of meaning.\n\nThe auditory cortex receives diverse neuromodulatory projections, and these projections can alter sound processing within the auditory cortex. But it's difficult to determine if these projections help encode the valence identity of the sound, or simply just reflect salience\n\n#BLA is recipricocally connected to auditory cortex. Primary auditory cortex receives most BLA afferents, while auditory association cortex sends most BLA efferents.\n\nYang 2016 show that lateral amygdala projections to the auditory cortex are required for full auditory fear association, and that they initiate an increase in spine density that persists for weeks\n\nModel 1: auditory cortex encodes identity and overall salience of sound, relaying information to prefrontal and subcortical areas where valence identity is encoded.\n\nModel 2: auditory cortex encodes identity, salience, and nature of salience (appetitive or aversive), then passes along to other cortical (eg prefrontal) and subcortical areas for further behavioral selection \n* in this model, affective encoding does not happen in prefrontal\n\nIf Model 2, inhibiting amygdala during acquisition would prevent auditory cortex from learning quality of association. Inhibiting amygdala during recall would impair freezing response mediated by amygdala.\n\nCombining models would create a system in which the identity and nature of emotional stimulus is encoded at the amygdala, with additional valence and behavioral consequence information encoded in the cortex.\n\n![[Auditory cortex encodes salience -- and possibly valence -- of emotional stimuli.]]\n\n# Related papers\n[[Cambiaghi_Sacchetti_2017_Front.

While the hippocampus has been at the center of attention for decades, it is now clear that other regions, in particular the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are taking an active part as well. Recent evidence suggests that the mPFC‚Äîtraditionally implicated in the long-term storage of memories‚Äîis already critical for the early phases of memory formation such as encoding. In this review, we summarize these findings, relate them to the functional importance of the mPFC connectivity, and discuss the role of the mPFC during memory consolidation with respect to the different theories of memory storage. Owing to its high functional connectivity to other brain areas subserving memory formation and storage, the mPFC emerges as a central hub across the lifetime of a memory, although much still remains to be discovered.\n\n# Key points\n- mPFC in Early Memory Phases\n- mPFC Engram\n- Post-Learning molecular modifications in mPFC\n- mPFC functional connectivity\n\t- inhibiting input to mPFC ([[basolateral amygdala]] \u003e [[prelimbic]], [[entorhinal cortex]] \u003e [[prelimbic]], [[hippocampus]] \u003e [[anterior cingulate]]) during encoding impairs remote memory but has no effect on recent memory, for contextual fear conditioning\n\t\t- differs from [[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience.

To disentangle requires showing the manipulation impairs retrieval but not expression (eg recall cue presentation vs fox urine presentation or something).\n\n### Early retrieval of fear memories\nAcquisition of auditory fear memory requires integration of snesory information in amygdala. Information about tone and shock from cortical and thalamic areas converage on lateral amygdala neurons, causing synaptic changes that sotre tone-shock associations. Similar changes occur in central amygdala.\n\n#### [[Amygdala]] microcircuits for early retrieval\n[[basolateral amygdala]] is necessary for retrieval of fear memory 24 hr following conditioning. BLA projects to central amygdala, which projects to [[hypothalamus]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] which mediates autonomic fear functions and behavioral correlates.Central lateral amygdala neurons seem to inhibit central medial amygdalar neurons during fear memory.\n\n#### Early retrieval requires [[prelimbic]]\nMany [[prelimbic]] neurons show sustained tone-evoked firing 24 h after cued-fear conditioning. These responses depend on [[basolateral amygdala]]input to [[prelimbic]] (Sotres-Bayon 2012 Neuron; Senn 2014 Neuron). [[prelimbic]] projects to [[basolateral amygdala]] also facilitate fear retrieval [[Do-Monte...Quirk (2015) Nature. A temporal shift in the circuits mediating fear memory]]. Early (24 hr) retrieval also shows a increased 4 Hz coherence between [[prelimbic]] and [[basolateral amygdala]]. Artificially driving PL-BLA circuit at 4 Hz induces freezing in naive mice (Karalis 2016 Nat Neuro).\n\n### Late retrieval of fear memories\nPrimary auditory cortex neurons show increased tone-evoked firing 1-4 hr after tone fear learning (Quirk...LeDoux 1997 Neuron). [[auditory cortex]] latency (~30ms) is longer than [[basolateral amygdala]] amygdala latency (~15ms), suggesting [[basolateral amygdala]] resposne is independent of primary [[auditory cortex]] [[Romanski and LeDoux (1992). Journal of Neuroscience. Equipotentiality of Thalamo-Amygdala and Thalamo-CorticoAmygdala Circuits in Auditory Fear Conditioning]] . Primary [[auditory cortex]] is critical for complex tones and trace fear conditioning though [[Letzkus...Luthi (2011) - Nature - A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex]]\n\n[[temporal association cortex]] is critical for remote fear memory recall [[Sacco and Sacchetti (2010) Science.

The higher order auditory cortex is involved in the assignment of affective value to sensory stimuli]]\n\nEvolving role of [[temporal association cortex]] in auditory fear conditioning parallels [[anterior cingulate]] in contextual fear conditioning.  [[anterior cingulate]] is required at 30 days but not 1 day, opposite the hippocampus (Frankland 2004 Science).  Retrieval of fear memories is associated with [[anterior cingulate]] spine growth, and blocking [[anterior cingulate]] spine growth in the first week after learning disrupts consolidation and remote retrieval (Vetere 2011 PNAS).\n\nThere is mixed evidence for the role of [[basolateral amygdala]] in late fear memory retrieval. Lots of early lesion studies in rodents suggest its necessary. Monkey studies do not. And more recent opto studies show silencing [[basolateral amygdala]] output at even semi-recent timepoint (3d, 6d) does not disrupt freezing. Overall suggests [[basolateral amygdala]] is required for early (1 day) but not older fear memory retrieval. \n# Related\n\n\n# Comments\nWhat is the timepoint for recruitment of PVT?

Interesting.\n\n![[Auditory association cortex (Te2) activity is driven by emotional learning]]\n\nHigher order sensory cortices participate in perception of sensory signals as well as shape, and are shaped, by the emotional response; they participate in linking sensory stimuli to their aÔ¨Äective meaning and in storing this information over time.\n\nsensory cortex is likely engaged in both recent and remote memories.

Contexts are made up of their discrete elements but are quickly learned as a getalt. Multiple memories, each with different variations of a context, can be associated with the same context.\n\n[[hippocampus]] plays a crucial role in defining the spatial component of a context.

Drfit is seen across types of memories and across different regions, suggesting that drift is a ubiquitous feature of memory systems. \n \nSynaptic turnover happens constantly across a substantial portion of cells -- even in the absence of action potentials. This could be one mechanism by which drift happens. Persistent spines are more consistent in the cortex than in hippocampus (Attardo 2015) Spine turnover rate positively correlates with ability to learn new task (Frank 2018) and is required for learning. \n \n Memory retrieval re-activates the neural state space of that memory, which can be described as limiting the possible neural state space available for encoding a new encoding. Events occurring with close temporal proximity can modify each other. \"Memory allocation hypothesis\": the excitability of a neuron predisposes it for encoding a memory. Because the excitability and connectivity of all neurons is constantly changing, there are constantly shifting possibilities for new neurons to join the memory network. \n \n Synaptic potentiation is saturated in engram neurons (Choi et al 2018), suggesting that as neurons exit the ensemble, they are depotentiated. This could be due to suppression from other neurons competing to be in the ensemble -- eg, ensembles formed during extinction learning inhibit ensembles formed during fear learning (Lacagnina 2019). Re-activating ensembles alongside new neurons that represent new information can link the two, incorporating elements of new and old firing patterns into a new ensemble. This modified ensemble then represents the updated memory. \n \n New memories are not created arbitrarily but instead are contrained by the existing functional connections between neurons, which facilitate pre-existing patterns of activity. Both excitability and functional connectivity bias the composition and temporal coordination of recruited neurons during memory-updating. But to actually induce physical changes in the synaptic strengths of these ensembles, the brain must modify synapses using plasticity proteins in concert with temporally coincident neural activity. \n \n For neurons to form a network, they need to spike in a temporally coordinated fashion at the millisecond scale -- [[spike timing dependent plasticity]] (Bi and Poo, 1998)\n\n# Related\n[[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience.

Can model animal as ellipse, detecting heading and angle as well. Animal pose estimation tracks limbs and joints of animals. Rich literature on human pose estimation (eg facial recognition). Heatmaps / confidence map representation of landmark locations encodes the location of each landmark as a density function of a 2D Gaussian distribution centered on the ground truth image coordinates of each landmark. This compares the probability of each tracked point being assigned to each landmark. Convolutional neural nets (CNNs) are well-suited for this. Problem of having the training dataset to compare the tracked points to. One approach is to use transfer learning to apply the parameters learned from a broad set of images to a specific set of images, allowing fine-tuning and minimizing the need for learning. \n### Quantifying the dynamics of behavior \nSimplest way to define behavior is to have fixed set of rules parameterizing the behavior. This maay fail to capture the variability of a behavior. A more flexible approach is to use computer-aided classification via supervised machine learning -- though this still suffers from the bias of humans annotating the behavioral examples. Another alternative to have computer learning identify clusters of distinct states. Typially, dimensionality reduction and feature extraction (PCA, t-SNE (t-stochastic neighbor embedding) are applied to raw data (post estimation). The similarity between points is quantified (Euclidean distance). Clustering then attempts to group all points such that each cluster is more similar to its within-group members than its outside-group members. Popular methods such as k-means and Guassian mixed models require a priori assumptions of the numbers of clusters. Density based clustering (watershed transformation) avoid a priori estimates of cluster number, by identifying \"peaks in the estimated distribution of time points in the space of extracted features\". Clusters will be self-similar, but may not neatly fit into human labels. One problem is these identify combinations of behaviors (walking and sniffing) as a distinct behavior, not as from its component parts. Hidden Markov models are popular, with explciit modeling of the characteritstics defining behavioral systems. \n# Related\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.977868694Z","tags":null},"/reviews/Popa-Hewitt-Ebner-2014.-Fr-Sys-Neuro.-The-cerebellum-for-jocks-and-nerds":{"title":"","content":"created: 20200805142646074\nfirst_author: Popa\njournal: Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience\nlast_author: Ebner\n\ntags: #review #cerebellum #cognition \nyear: 2014\n\n# Related concepts and papers\n* [[universal cerebellar transform]]\n* Wagner...Luo (2019)\n\n# Summary\nIf the [[universal cerebellar transform]] is real, that means we can apply knowledge of cerebellar motor computations to cognitive domains\n\n[[Purkinje cells]] in different parts of the cerebellum encode kinematics of different motor behaviors\n\nIndividual [[Purkinje cells]] encode both prediction of consequences of motor commands as well as respond to sensory feedback\n\nTherefore, modulation of one area of the cerebellum can have cascading effects on the internal model, by disrupting just a piece of the internal model\n\nComplex spikes are traditionally thought of as error signals, but that's an incomplete understanding.

Modern thinking is more steeped in the associative tradition, originating in philosophy. It views conditioning as learning the relations among events in the evironment, which is used to represent the structure of the world. Within that associative framework, Pavlovian conditioning is a vast domain with rich representations of the world and links between those representations and behavior. \n\nThere are three parts of Pavlovian condititioning (all called Pavlovian conditioning): the circumstances producing learning (the experimental procedure of CS and US), the content of the learning (the act itself of making these associations), and then the effects of the learning on behavior. \n\n### Circumstances producing Pavlovian conditioning \nTraditional 'US-CS' conditioning requires pairing or contiguity of the US and CS. The associative view does not require contiguity. It emphasizes how much information one stimulus gives about another. This means that learning is largely based on the base rate of the US. If it occurs frequently, both out but always during the CS, there is little learning. But if it occurs infrequently, but always during the CS, there is a lot of learning. \n\n### Content of Pavlovian Conditioning: what is learned \nLearning is not restricted to relation between CS evoking US. Associations are formd among complex representations, which are themselves linked in relationships to other representations (transitive property of association). For example, each during CS-US learning, both are also associated with context in which they occurred (Balsam and Tomie, 1985). The web of relational learning allows for complex, content-rich representations of the world. \n\n### Influences on behavior \nThe CS does not simply evoke the behavior of the US. For example, shock evokes movement; tone associated with shock evokes freezing. Additionally, the nature of the CS can affect behavior. Pavlovian conditioning is not a shifting of behavioral response from US to CS, but generates behavior that is informed by information given by the presence of the CS and its associations.\n\n# Related\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures\nQuote:\n\u003eDescriptions of conditioning, such as those just cited, come from a long and honorable tradition in physiology, the reflex tradition in which Pavlov worked and within which many early behaviorists thought. This tradition sees conditioning as a kind of low-level mechanical process in which the control over a response is passed from one stimulus to another. Much modern thinking about conditioning instead derives largely from the associative tradition originating in philosophy. It sees conditioning as the learning that results from exposure to relations among events in the environment. Such learning is a primary means by which the organism represents the structure of its world. Consequently, Pavlovian conditioning must have considerable richness, both in the relations it represents and in the ways its representation influences behavior, a richness that was not envisioned within the reflex tradition.\n\n\u003ePavlovian conditioning is not a stupid process by which the organism willy-nilly forms associations between any two stimuli that happen to co-occur. Rather, the organism is better seen as an information seeker using logical and perceptual relations among events, along with its own preconceptions, to form a sophisticated representation of its world.","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.977868694Z","tags":null},"/reviews/Richter-Levin...Schmidt-2019-Mol-Psych.-Animal-models-of-PTSD_-a-challenge-to-be-met":{"title":"","content":"created: 20210416184621062\nfirst_author: Richter-Levin\njournal: Molecular Psychiatry\nlast_author: Schmidt\nmethods: review\nmodified: 20210504034007824\nspecies: \ntags: #PTSD #disease-model #animal-model #review\nyear: 2019\n\n\n!!1 Line\nAnimal models of PTSD should seek to align with both DSM and RDoC criteria, while accounting for individual variation in the response to the PTSD-inducing manipulation, similar to the variation seen in human resilience to PTSD.\n\n\n!!Key points\n\nAnimal models of PTSD should factor in both the [[DSM-5 PTSD criteria]] and the [[RDoc domains]].\n\nImportant to study both the early and late effects of PTSD.

Saw consistent odorant-specific differences across all channels of 64 electrode EEG, suggesting universal participation in odorant information. \n\n\"All that distinguished one odorant EEG pattern from another was the spatial configuration of the average intensity over an event time window at the common frequency, in the manner that patterns of monochromatic light are distinguished from each other by shades of gray. Local variations in phase, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and other aspects of the 64 traces were not found to contain odorant-specific information.\" \n\n### Noise vs chaos\nDifference between noise and chaos: a noisey system is stochastic (truly random). A chaotic system is deterministic -- ie given a start state, the outcome is predictable -- but the initial state of the system has a random component to it. Chaos is controlled noise with precisely defined properties \"\n\nFigure 11 indicates that the olfactory system and its corresponding model have a hierarchy of states. The basic neural dynamics and the equations are the same in all states but, depending on various neural conditions and model parameters, the systems behave differently (e.g., during waking, sleeping, bursts, interburst intervals, seizures, and so on). Both systems display the capacity for abrupt, dramatic, global jumps from one state to another. These are the bifurcations. These are analogous to phase transitions in physical systems: ice to water to steam, for example. The bifurcations occur in many forms and varieties, so a formal definition is difficult if not impossible to provide.\" \n\n### Roles of chaos in odor recognition\n\"We postulate that the selection of an attractor upon inhalation is made by the presence of a CS odorant in the inhaled air or by the absence of an odorant, leading to the selection of an attractor corresponding to the background odor, the behavioral status quo. That is, the chemical stimulation of a particular set of receptors places the mechanism into a particular basin when the attractors emerge under bifurcation. The system is released into its basal state with exhalation, setting the stage for the processing of a new sample of information about an odor in the inhaled air...We conjecture that chaotic activity provides a way of exercising neurons that is guaranteed not to lead to cyclic entrainment or to spatially structured activity\" \n\n\"In our view, then, chaos plays several crucial roles; the system is designed and built so as to ensure its own steady and controlled source of \"noise\" (i.e., chaos). Most remarkably, \"signals\" are not detected \"in\" the chaos because the mechanism turns the chaos \"off' when it turns a signal \"on.\"\n\n\n### Learning and nerve cell assemblies\nNerve cell assemblies (NCAs) = ensembles\n\"During exhalation, when receptor input is low, the bulbar neurons tend to fall to a low level of activity and sensitivity. During inhalation the surge of receptor input not only excites bulbar neurons, it augments exponentially their tendency to fire in response to input from receptors and from each other. Their strength of interaction increases dramatically over the entire bulb. At some point a threshold is reached in which the entire bulbar mechanism bifurcates from a low-energy chaotic state to a high-energy state. The NCA operates at the moment of choice when the surge of receptor input strongly forces the bulb far away from its rest state to some new activity pattern.\"\n- sensory input not only activates the relevant sensory receptors, but brings them to a state in which ensemble can more easily activate them as well, resulting in pattern completion and amplification of a learned signal pattern.\n- Analogy to diastolic vs systolic modes (wrt heart beats)\n\n### Roles of chaos\n\"We have suggested that without chaotic behavior the neural system cannot add a new odor to its repertoire of learned odors. Chaos provides the system with a deterministic \"I don't know\" state within which new activity patterns can be generated, as shown by what happens when the system encounters a previously unknown odor. If the odor occurs without reinforcement, habituation takes place; thereafter, the neural system exhibits patterned activity that we have identified as the control state for the status quo. With reinforcement, however, a completely different process occurs. If the odor is novel and the system does not already have a global activity pattern corresponding to the odor, then instead of producing one of its previously learned activity patterns, the system falls into a high-level chaotic state rather than into the basin for the background odor. This \"chaotic well\" enables the system to avoid all of its previously learned activity patterns and to produce a new one.\"\n\n\"In the neural system, chaos is the rule, and the patterned activity to which the system converges following each state change is never twice the same, so again the notion of pattern completion loses its meaning.\"\n\n\"We think that the notion of \"destabilization\" provides a better description of the essentials of neural functioning than the concept of pattern completion. In an alert, motivated animal, input destabilizes the system, leading to further destabilization and a bifurcation to a new form of patterned activity.\"\n\n# Related\n\n\n# Comments\n\n# Figures\n![[Pasted image 20211119165601.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20211119171821.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.977868694Z","tags":null},"/reviews/Squire...Morris-2015.-CSHP.-Memory-Consolidation":{"title":"","content":"first_author: Squire\njournal: Cold Springs Harbor Perspective\nlast_author: Morris\n\ntags: #review #systems-consolidation\n\n# Summary\nGreat entry article into systems consolidation theory of memory.

The MTT postulates that the hippocampal formation is the first to encode the initial information upon learning, in a sparse and distributed manner, and that, similarly as in the IT, this hippocampal ensemble acts as an index to link the cortical neurons that are also representing the incoming information. Both neuronal ensembles, cortical and hippocampal, form the full memory trace, or engram as we would call it nowadays. The hippocampus provides the contextual information to link the individual pieces of information stored in the cortex from the start. However, in contrast to the IT, a new hippocampal trace will be created at each recall, indexing the same, or part of the same, cortical information, resulting in the creation of parallel and multiple traces distributed in the brain, making them harder to disrupt or erase.\n[[Dixsaut _ Graff _ 2021 _  Inj J Mol Sci _ The Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Fear Memory - Dynamics, Connectivity, and Engrams]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.977868694Z","tags":null},"/reviews/systems-consolidation":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T20:23:35.977868694Z","tags":null}}
