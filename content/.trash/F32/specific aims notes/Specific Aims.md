# Motivation
Traumatic experiences, such as combat exposure or sexual assault, can result in fearful behavior that too often becomes maladaptive, resulting in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. While the behavioral output -- a pronounced fear response -- may remain stable over time, the underlying neural circuitry is increasingly understood to be dynamic, undergoing extensive reorganization throughout the consolidation process. In parallel, clinical research shows that remote memories of trauma are more difficult to treat than recent memories, suggesting a link between evolution of the memory and treatment-resistance. A well-characterized tool to experimentally induce a traumatic experience and examine re-exposure across time is cued fear conditioning, in which a neutral stimulus predicts an aversive stimulus. This task has been used for decades to understand the circuitry and mechanisms behind fear memory, but recent advances in the scientific toolkit have recently made tangible novel and important questions about the evolving neural dynamics of fear memory. Understanding the evolution of fear memory is central to understanding the process of traumatic memory consolidation and may identify critical timepoints for intervention in the consolidation process.

The prefrontal cortex, in line with its broad connectivity, coordinates the response of other cortical and subcortical areas during fear behavior. In particular, the prelimbic cortex (PL) coordinates fear expression and does so through different circuitry at different timepoints, favoring cortical areas at remote timepoints. In parallel to the literature on the dynamic role of  PL, another cortical region -- the temporal association cortex (TeA) -- is critical for the recall of remote but not recent fear memory of an auditory cue. Despite reciprocal connectivity between these two areas, and their parallel functional evolutions controlling fear behavior, no research has investigated if, how, and when PL > TeA connectivity controls fear memory.  In the proposed research strategy, I will use projection-specific in-vivo tools to:  1) dissect the causal role of PL>TeA projections in recent and remote cued fear memory via optogenetic manipulations, 2) decode the information in PL>TeA neurons at recent and remote timepoints via calcium imaging, 3) identify critical activity windows for PL>TeA circuit consolidation via chemogenetics.

# Aims
Aim 1: Determine the functional evolution of PL > TeA circuitry in memory recall
1.1 - Test the necessity and sufficiency of PL > TeA projections in recent cued memory
Hypothesis:  PL>TeA will be neither necessary nor sufficient for recent cued recall
1.2 - Test the necessity and sufficiency of PL > TeA projections in remote cued memory
Hypothesis: PL>TeA will be both necessary and sufficient for remote recall

Aim 2: Determine the computational evolution of PL > TeA neurons in memory recall
2.1 - Decode the activity of PL>TeA during recent cued recall
Hypothesis: neurons will weakly encode tone
2.2 - Decode the activity of PL>TeA during remote cued recall
Hypothesis: neurons will encode tone and freezing

Aim 3: Determine the activity-dependent timepoints required for evolution of PL>TeA mediating remote recall
3.1 - Chronically inhibit PL>TeA neurons during early consolidation (1-6d)
Hypothesis:  strong impairment of remote memory
3.2 - Chronically inhibit PL>TeA neurons during late consolidation (7-13d)
Hypothesis:  weak impairment of remote memory

# Conclusion
Understanding the nature of PL - TeA interaction across fear memory will not only enhance our understanding of the dynamic and complex role of the PFC, but it may also identify a novel pathway for regulation of fear and treatment of traumatic experiences.
