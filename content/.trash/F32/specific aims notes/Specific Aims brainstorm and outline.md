# Motivation
Traumatic experiences, such as combat exposure or sexual assault, may generate maladaptive fearful behavior that too often results in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. While the behavioral output -- a pronounced fear response -- may remain stable, the underlying neural circuits mediating that behavior undergo extensive reoganization. In classic associative conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (tone) is paired with an unconditioned aversive stimulus (mild shock), which then imbues the conditioned stimulus with the aversive qualities of the unconditioned stimulus. This task results in long-lasting fear memory,

- human health relevance, broad: 
	- traumatic experience result in persistent fearful behavior
	- behavior stable, circuit dynamic
- human health, specific:
	- remote memories more difficult to treat than recent ones
- task relevance
	- associative learning task, well characterized, now equipped with tools to study unanswered questions
- neural circuits for health
	- understanding the evolution of cortical fear memory circuitry is critical to understand the process of traumatic memory consolidation
	- may identify critical timepoints for intervention in the consolidation process

- PFC has broad role, broad connectivity 
- PL evolving role in memory
	- projections to TeA, mature over time, correlate with freezing
- TeA evolving role in memory
	- evolving role over time
- despite connectivity, and changes to connectivity, these two fields have not been explored
- will use opto, miniscopes, ??, to understand the evolution of this circuitry and its role in recall of remote memory

# Aims
Aim 1: Determine the functional evolution of PL > TeA circuitry in memory recall
1.1 - Test the necessity and sufficiency of PL > TeA projections in recent cued memory
Hypothesis:  PL>TeA will be neither necessary nor sufficient for recent cued recall
1.2 - Test the necessity and sufficiency of PL > TeA projections in remote cued memory
Hypothesis: PL>TeA will be both necessary and sufficient for remote recall

Aim 2: Determine the computational evolution of PL > TeA neurons in memory recall
2.1 - Decode the activity of PL>TeA during recent cued recall
Hypothesis: neurons will weakly encode tone
2.2 - Decode the activity of PL>TeA during remote cued recall
Hypothesis: neurons will encode tone and freezing

Aim 3: Determine the activity-dependent timepoints required for evolution of PL>TeA mediating remote recall
3.1 - Chronically inhibit PL>TeA neurons during early consolidation (1-6d)
Hypothesis:  strong impairment of remote memory
3.2 - Chronically inhibit PL>TeA neurons during late consolidation (7-13d)
Hypothesis:  weak impairment of remote memory

(instead of 3?)
Aim 4: Determine the evolution of functional input to PL>TeA neurons
4.1 - Identify the afferent input to PL>TeA neurons active at recent recall
4.2 - Identify the afferent input to PL>TeA neurons active at remote recall
