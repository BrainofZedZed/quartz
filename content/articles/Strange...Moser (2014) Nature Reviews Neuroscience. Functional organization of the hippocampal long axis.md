Review article on how the [[hippocampus]] is along the septotemporal axis.

!!Key Ideas
*In 2000s, common trope was that dorsal hippocampus = cognitive, ventral hippocampus = affective.
*New anatomical, molecular, and functional evidence indicates that hippocampus is organized along the septotemporal axis in both gradually changing and sharply demarcated ways.
**long axis gradient
***place field size
***connectivity between various cortical and subcortical regions
****[[entorhinal cortex]] has a dorsolateral to ventromedial topographical projections along hippocampal dorsal-ventral axis  (EC projections cross medial/lateral border)
****hippocampus has dorsal-ventral topographical projections to [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[amygdala]]
****monoaminergic projections (including [[locus coeruleus]]) project more strongly to ventral hippocampus
**dorsal third, intermediate, and ventral third with clearly demarcated genetic expression domains
**additional ventral third demarcations
***ventral third and dorsal 2/3 have high degree of intrinsic connectivity
***ventral third more involved in [[fear conditioning]]
*These organizational patterns are reflected by other parts of the brain in communication with the hippocampus
**the dorsal-ventral increase in place cell size is mirrored by an increase in spacing between [[grid cells]] in the [[entorhinal cortex]]
**Ventral HC implicated in fear memory, perhaps because large place field of ventral cells make computation easier, and linking larger swaths of space to affective values is an evolutionarily conservation approach (as opposed to linking tighter swaths of space). ie safer to mark a wider area as dangerous
