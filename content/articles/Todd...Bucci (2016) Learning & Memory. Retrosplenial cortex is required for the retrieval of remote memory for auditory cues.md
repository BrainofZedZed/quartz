# Summary
Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) has known involvement in spatial memory and strong connections to hippocampus and visuo-spatial regions. Been consistently shown to be necessary for recall of contextual fear memory, both early and remote. Also has been shown to NOT be necessary for recall of cued fear memory at recent timepoints. Given increased cortical involvement in remote memory, and that  RSC also shows increased IEG expression at remote memory recall compared to recent, investigated whether RSC is required for recall of remote cued fear memory.

Animals do tone-shock pairing, then recall 4 weeks later

RSC lesions impaired tone-recall (though more mild effect than contextual recall).

Chemogenetic inhibition of RSC prior to recall impaired tone recall but not context recall.

Retrograde tracer injected into RSC labeled primary and secondary auditory areas (Au1, AuV, AuD). Subiculum an thalamus (anterodorsal thalalmic nucleus) also strongly labeled.

# Open questions
* Does increased involvement of RSC (and other cortical areas) in remote memory reflect changes to the memory itself (ie generalization)? Or does it indicate the same quality of memory but distributed more broadly.
* What does this mean about the role of more spatial regions in contextual vs cued memory? 
* Is cued memory more similar to contextual memory at remote timepoints?
