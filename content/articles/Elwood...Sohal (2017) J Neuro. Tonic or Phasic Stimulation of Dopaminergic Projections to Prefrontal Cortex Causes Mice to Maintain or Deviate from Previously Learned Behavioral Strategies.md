# Summary
[[PFC]] [[dopamine]] is important to behavioral flexibility. Facilitates rapid shift from previously-learned strategy to new one when the rules of a task change.

Tonic firing is around 5 Hz and is baseline frequency. Phasic (~20Hz) occurs with unexpected events, both rewarding and aversive.
Tonic firing releases lower levels of DA in PFC and thought to stabilize a pattern of behavior. Phasic firing destabilizes present strategies, shifting the PFC to a new one.

Previously thought that phasic DA may be positive reinforcement learning. 
Lammel et al 2012 Nature suggests [[VTA]]-PFC carries aversive information.

Fiber photometry of VTA axons in PFC show response to learned reward cue, as well as small response to learned reward
Optp stim of VTA axons in PFC, neither tonic nor phasic, induces CPP.

Used a odor+texture discrimination task to measure behavioral flexibility

Did UNILATERAL PFC fiber stim. 

Phasic stimulation of VTA-PFC fibers impairs learning (increased trials to achieve criterion) with no effect on perseveration.
Tonic stimulation of VTA-PFC fibers impairs learning and increases perseveration.

With BILATERAL stim

Fiber stim was not a strong enough reinforced to learn task, in lieu of food reward. Direct stim of VTA was indeed sufficient, however.

Takeaways:
VTA-PFC encodes rewards and cues linked to future rewards, but not reward omission.
Tonic stimulation maintains previously learned associations.
Phasic bursts are not reinforcing but can trigger deviation from current behavior if behavior isn't rewarded.
