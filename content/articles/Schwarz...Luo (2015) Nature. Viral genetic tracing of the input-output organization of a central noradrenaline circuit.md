# Summary

This is thee paper that established a rabies-based technique for synapse specific circuit tracing, pre-synaptically and post-synaptically. Called TRIO (Tracing Relationship between Inputs and Outputs). 

Presynaptic connections are determined via rabies-virus mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing (Site B --> Site A). This spreads an EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein deleted, GFP expressing rabies virus (RVdG) from infected cells in Site B (Starter Cells) to presynaptic cells (Site A).

In order for RVdG to infect the Starter Cells, those cells need to express the TVA receptor for EnvA (fused to mCherry) and a glycoprotein. This is achieved by injection of a cre-dependent AAV.

Cre-expression in Starter Cells is achieve by canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-cre) injection into postsynapic cells, Site C. CAV-cre infects axon terminals.

The paper traces wide ranging inputs and outputs to the [[locus coeruleus]]

Of note, it shows novel projections directly from Purkinje cells to the [[locus coeruleus]]. 8-10% of all Purkinje cells projected to the [[locus coeruleus]].

Of those [[locus coeruleus]] neurons receiving Purkinje cell projections, about 3% also projected to the [[hippocampus]].
