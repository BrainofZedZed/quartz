Piriform cortex neurons gradually and cumulatively drift in their representation of odors.

# Abstract


# Key points
Within each day, responses at both global and single unit level were stable and reliable. Over time, most (95%) of neurons changed their tuning and did so gradually. Neither baseline nor spontaneous changes correlated with changes in tuning. Fear conditioning does not stabilize the odor-evoked response. Why? Suggests that piriform cortex operates as a 'scratch pad' for rapid encoding upon lmited odor exposure, with drift being a product of continuous odor exposure and rewriting of local circuitry. Futher suggests that the unstructed input to piriform from olfactory bulb combined with recurrent local connections drives the drift.
