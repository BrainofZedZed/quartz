# Abstract
>Impaired cortical maturation is a postulated mechanism in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. In the sensory cortex, activity relayed by the thalamus during a postnatal sensitive period is essential for proper cortical maturation. Whether thalamic activity also shapes prefrontal cortical maturation is unknown. We show that inhibiting the mediodorsal and midline thalamus in mice during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in thalamoâ€“prefrontal projection density and reduced excitatory drive to prefrontal neurons. It also caused prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits during adulthood associated with disrupted prefrontal cross-correlations and task outcome encoding. Thalamic inhibition during adulthood had no long-lasting consequences. Exciting the thalamus in adulthood during a cognitive task rescued prefrontal cross-correlations, task outcome encoding and cognitive deficits. These data point to adolescence as a sensitive window of thalamocortical circuit maturation. Furthermore, by supporting prefrontal network activity, boosting thalamic activity provides a potential therapeutic strategy for rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.

# Key points
Fig 1 - hM4Di in midline thalamus during adolescence (P20 - P50) impairs learning rate on Non-Match to Sample (NMS) task. No effects if inhbition in adult mice.
Fig 2- adolescent midline thalamus inhibition decreases PFC pyramidal neuron activity as adult, ie persistent effects 
Fig 3 - adolescent midline thalamus inhibition decreases thalamus-PFC projection density. No effect on BLA-PFC projection density.
Fig 4- used stabilized step function opsin (SSFO) to persistently increase activity in midline thalamus, rescueing deficits on extra dimensional set shifting (EDSS) task

Fig 5 - in all animals, (control, hM4D, hM4D + SSFO) PFC gamma power is higher on correct than incorrect trials, though hM4D might have smaller effect size. samples are trials, irrespective of animal. overall suggests changes in gamma do not explain deficit in EDSS.
Fig 5 background - during EDSS task, increase in PFC gamma frequency previously observed during correct trials. Other  oscillations, like PFC beta, also had no manipulation effect (Fig S6a). No difference across manipulations in thalamo-PFC coherence or phase locking (Fig S6c,d,f). Together, shows oscillatory activity cannot explain behavioral deficit.

Authors previously reported that adolescent inhibition of PFC [[PV]] neurons disrupts adult PFC gamma during task. Because these results do not align, suggests that PFC PV neurons may not be involved in this deficit.

# Comments
Subtle but reproduced phenotype. Able to resolve with direct manipulations. But lacking a relevant model to show how reduced thalamic>PFC activity would occur naturally. Also only a weak mechanism to explain why deficits are present.
