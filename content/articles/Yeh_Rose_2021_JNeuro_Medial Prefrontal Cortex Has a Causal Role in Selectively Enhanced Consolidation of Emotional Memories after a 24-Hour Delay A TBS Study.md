# 1 Line
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the [[PFC]] in humans during encoding of objects in negatively valenced scene enhanced 24hr but not 30min memory.

# Abstract


# Key points
Encoding of objects in neutrally valenced scene was unaffected. 
Overall suggests that [[PFC]] activity during encoding interacts with the consolidation process preferentially preserving negatively salient (or perhaps just salient) information.
