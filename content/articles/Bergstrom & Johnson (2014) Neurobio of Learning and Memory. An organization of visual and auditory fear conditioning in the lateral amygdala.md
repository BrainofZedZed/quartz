# Summary
Using p-ERK1/2 as marker of recent activity, saw similar activation in lateral amygdala with auditory CS than visual CS. 

Saw topographically similar LA activation across animals with auditory, but not visual, CS (auditory part replicates previous findings)

Found a specific micro region of the ventral medial LA that was consistently activated across animals with visual stimulus, but not auditory.

# Key points
* In fear conditioning chamber, background lux = 1, < 50 dB
* for visual CS:  1 Hz light, 50% duty cycle, 35 lux, 20s duration
*[[Similar levels of freezing ensures similar strength of fear memory]]
*Places overlapping and distinct LA responsive areas in context of cell assembly theory (Hebbian plasticity), indicating overlapping functionality of same populations in LA (multimodal fear functionality), as well as some distinct populations. 
* Argues for relevance of multi-modal fear conditioning study with the idea that real-world fear-cues are likely multimodal, and therefore it's important to understand multiple modalities.
* TE2 projections to LA correspond to areas of increased p-ERK1/2 specific to visual cue.
