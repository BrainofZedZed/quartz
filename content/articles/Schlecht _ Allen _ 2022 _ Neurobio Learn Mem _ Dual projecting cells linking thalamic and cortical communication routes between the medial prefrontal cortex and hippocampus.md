# 1 Line
The two major routes of communication between [[PFC]] and [[hippocampus]] are the ventral midline [[thalamus]] and lateral [[entorhinal cortex]]. Cells that project to both vmThal and LEC are found in medial [[septum]], ventral [[subiculum]], and medial entorhinal cortex. No dual-projecting cells were found in either mPFC or HC.
