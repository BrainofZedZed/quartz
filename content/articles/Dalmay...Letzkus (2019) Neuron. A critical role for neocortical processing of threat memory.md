# Summary

![[Temporal association area is sufficient and necessary for expression of recent fear memory.]]

BACKGROUND

We understand much of the neocortex computations, and the architecture of neocortical circuits, but don't know much about how neocortical functions enable behavior and behavioral flexibility. This is complicated by the parallel processing happening with behaviorally relevant stimuli.

Many lesion studies of the neocortex show no behavioral effect, begging the question how does neocortex enable behavior. Auditory cortex and fear conditioning have an uncertain relationship. Some lesion studies find critical roles in learning and expressing fear memory; others do not.  Similar mixed literature for more modern techniques including opto and drugs.

The authors found that higher order auditory areas (ventral secondary auditory area, [[temporal association cortex]]) are required for acquisition and retrieval of fear memory using complex, more naturalistic conditioned auditory stimuli (frequency sweeps) but not necessarily for pure tones.

* Higher order auditory cortex (temporal neocorex; ventral secondary auditory cortex and [[temporal association cortex]]) is required for fear memory acquisition and retrieval regardless of auditory stimulus complexity

# Key points

* No effect of inhibition of Au1, AuV, or #TeA on context retrieval (but may have been confounded by ceiling effect)

* Activity of amygdala projecting neurons in [[temporal association cortex]] is sensitive to learned salience of auditory stimulus
* Used Principal Component Analysis on the population activity of ~AuV to look at PCA vector activity of first three PCs; used distance traveled in PC space as metric for distinctiveness between responses to different stimuli
	* Interesting approach to look at population activity. Seems to be helpful when the population has a diverse response. Should keep in mind for future use. #cool-methods 
* Projections from [[temporal association cortex]] to amygdala control fear memory expression
* Inhibition of Au1, ~AuV, and [[temporal association cortex]] during either acquisition or retrieval of fear memory impaired freezing, with either pure tone or FM sweep CS
* Opto inhibtion of Au1 during retrieval decreased freezing if conditioned stimulus was an FM sweep but not a pure tone
	* Auditory cortex is required for conditioned fear memory retrieval with complex auditory stimuli
* Opto inhibition of primary auditory cortex (Au1) during fear memory acquisition, using pure tones or frequency modulated sweeps (FM sweeps), has no effect on freezing during recall
* Buried in supplemental is a visual fear conditioning experiment. No effect of Au1/AuV/TeA inhibition on visual CS+ recall. Also weak freezing on average (~25%)

Auditory cortex isn't required for conditioned fear memory acquisition
