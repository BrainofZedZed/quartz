[[prelimbic]] > [[amygdala]] neurons are active at very recent (2h) recall while showing increased cue-induced activity, while [[prelimbic]] > [[paraventricular]] thalamus neurons are active at more remote (4-7d) timepoints and show reduced cue-induced firing rate alongside increased spontaneous firing.

# Abstract
Tone fear-conditioned rats while recording from [[prelimbic]]. Did retrieval either early (2h) or late (7d). Found increased cFos in [[prelimbic]]>[[amygdala]] (layer II-III) at early retrieval, but increased cFos in [[prelimbic]]>[[paraventricular]] (layer VI) at 7d timepoint. At similar timepoints, saw cue-induced increase in Layer V (ie PL>BLA) firing rate at 2h, and cue-induced decrease in Layer VI (PL>PVT) firing rate at 4d

# Key points
- Decrease in firing rate of Layer VI neurons at "remote" timepoint goes against literature, from this and other labs, showing sustained [[prelimbic]] activity with freezing. Authors suggest that the timepoint of choice (4-7d) affects this, because other studies looked at earlier timepoints. Additionally, they point to the increase in spontaneous firing as something that may be blunted
- Noted that in the earlier [[Do-Monte...Quirk (2015) Nature. A temporal shift in the circuits mediating fear memory]] paper, they started their opto silencing 10s before the tone.

# Comments
cFos effects are weak -- looks like increase in PL>PVT at early timepoint if there were more samples.
