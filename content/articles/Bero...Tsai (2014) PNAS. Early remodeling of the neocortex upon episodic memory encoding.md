# 1 Line
Inhibiting mPFC (anterior cingulate) during contextual fear conditioning disrupts physiological hippocampal plasticity processes and impairs both recent and remote recall.

# Key points
* CFC induces dendritic spine growth in mPFC and increased mEPSC frequency
*Inhibiting mPFC (mostly anterior cingulate) during contextual fear conditioning decreases expression of IEG zif268 and synaptophysin not only in mPFC but also in CA1 and entorhinal cortex. 
**This indicates that mPFC activation during learning feeds back into hippocampal formation circuitry.
* Inhibiting mPFC during CFC impairs recent recall (24 hr) as well as remote recall (28 day)

# Summary
This paper establishes a role for the "mPFC" -- the anterior cingulate -- in learning of contextual fear. Of interest, taking the ACC offline during learning DID indeed disrupt recent and remote recall, counter to effects seen when targeting the [[prelimbic]] (see [[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience. Temporal evolution of cortical ensembles promoting remote memory retrieval]]. Is this a difference of mPFC structure? Or fear paradigm (contextual vs cued)? 

Also, the decrease in hippocampal IEG expression in mPFC inhibited animals suggests an active and important role of PFC to hippocampus during learning and/or early consolidation, which goes opposite the general idea in [[systems consolidation]].
