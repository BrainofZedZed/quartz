> Fuster et al. (1985) were the first to investigate the effect of PFC cooling on spiking activity in inferotemporal (ITC) neurons during a delayed-matchto-sample task. During the delay period—when persistent stimulus-specific ITC activity is observed—cooling caused attenuated spiking profiles and a loss of stimulus-specificity in ITC neurons. These two alterations of ITC signaling strongly implicate the PFC as a source of top-down signals necessary for maintaining robust sensory representations in the absence of bottom-up sensory input.
