# Summary
Associative memory (eg fear conditioning) utilizes excitatory cortical projection neurons to coordinate brain regions and plasticity to adjust their weights. Inibhitory neurons are known to play a supporting role, and to be modulated by fear memory, however intracortical circuit plasticity, especially concerning inhibitory circuits, hasn't been fully investigated. The authors demonstrate that [[somatostatin]] neurons within [[prelimbic]] cortex show characteristics of memory storage.

# Key points
[[somatostatin]], but not parvalbumin, neurons in [[prelimbic]] fear conditioned mice (CS+US) show increased EPSCs and decreased paired-pulse ratios, indicative of potentiation of excitatory input.

[[somatostatin]] neurons in [[prelimbic]] cortex increase activity (recorded via fiber photometry) throughout CS-US acquisition.
Interestingly, activity increases throughout CS, seemingly anticipating the coterminating US.

Optogenetic modulation of [[prelimbic]] [[somatostatin]] neurons controls fear behavior during altered context fear memory retrieval.
Inhibition reduces freezing; excitation increases freezing.

[[prelimbic]] somatostatin neuron activity are necessary for fear memory acquisition. 

* Opto inhibition during fear memory conditioning decreases freezing, but not consistently; data is all over the place.
* Ephys data is more consistent though; manipulation prevented reduction in interevent interval of somatostatin neurons, as well as changes in paired-pulse ratio.
* Effect is similar to [[basolateral amygdala]] inhibition.

[[prelimbic]] somatostatin neurons, after fear memory acquisition, strongly inhibit parvalbumin neurons. 
The reverse is not true; PV neurons do not change their inhibitory weight to SST neurons.

* Required use of triple transgenic mice and use of INTRSCT viral expression

[[basolateral amygdala]] projections to [[prelimbic]] inhibitory neurons are modulated by fear memory acquisition.

* After learning, BLA-PL SST projections are mostly the same, slightly stronger; while BLA-PL PV projections are much weaker.
* This indicates weakening of feedforward inhibition driven by weaker BLA projections.

Opto stim of [[prelimbic]] somatostatin neurons after fear conditioning seems to reactivate brain-wide fear network, based on cFos IHC.
Without prior conditioning, no widespread activation

The fact that there was no effect of somatostatin modulation on context freezing suggests that SST neurons mediate cue associations and not environments.
