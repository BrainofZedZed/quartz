# 1 Line
Fear-conditioning (foot shock) activates Layer 1 auditory cortex (primary, some AuV) inhibitory neurons, which inhibit Layer 2/3 PV cells, disinhibiting pyramidal cells and facilitating auditory fear conditioning.

# Abstract
Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning.

# Key points
Used FM sweeps as CS+ and CS-.

FIG 1 muscimol inhibition of primary auditory cortex reduces freezing to both CS+ and CS- in fear conditioning paradigm. Using 2P on anesthetized mice, layer 1 inhibitory (GAD67+) neurons show a larger response to foot shock than layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons. Using 2P in combination with patch clamp, found most (75%) interneurons in layer 1 increased activity, while 25% strongly decreased activity following anesthetized footshock. This indicates that the primary auditory cortex is sensitive to footshock in an anesthetized animal, and that there are multiple layer 1 inhibitory neuron population response dynamics. 

FIG 2 NBQX (AMPAR antagonist) application to auditory cortex removed the initial response but largely left the population response intact. MEC&MLA (nAChR antagonists) application left initial response intact, but removed the rest of the population response. This indicates that there is an initial activity driven my glutamatergic input, while subsequent activity is driven my acetylcholine. 

FIG 3 Layer 2/3 PV+ cells are strongly inhibited by footshock during fear conditioning. Recorded in awake behaving animal. 

FIG 4 Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (putative, single unit recording) show they receive reduced IPSCs during shock, with a correspoding large increase in activity.

FIG 5 Activation of PV+ cells in auditory cortex during and after footshock reduces learned freezing to CS+ tested 24 hr later. Animals were able to be reconditioned to CS+ successfully. This indicates that PV activity prevents auditory associative learning. The paper shows strong evidence that primary auditory cortex Layer 1 interneurons inhibit Layer 2/3 PV cells, and increased layer 2/3 PV cell activity prevents learning. Believable mechanism, but doesn't directly show the causality. Early optogenetics, before inhibitory opsins?
