# Summary
[[prelimbic]] cortex seems to have divergent projections to [[basolateral amygdala]] and ventral [[striatum]] which differentially control avoidance behavior. PL to VS impairs avoidance, seemingly through a local inibitory mechanism, while PL to BLA increases avoidance, seemingly through BLA to VS projections.

# Key points
Manipulations in [[prelimbic]] targeted rostral portion.

Activating [[prelimbic]] projections to ventral [[striatum]] delays avoidance. Inhibition has no effect.

Activating [[prelimbic]] projections to [[basolateral amygdala]] increases avoidance. Inhibition strongly delays avoidance.

Activating [[basolateral amygdala]] projections to ventral [[striatum]] has no effect. Inhibition strongly delays avoidance.

Ventral striatum seems to be the ultimate gatekeeper of avoidance behavior.
