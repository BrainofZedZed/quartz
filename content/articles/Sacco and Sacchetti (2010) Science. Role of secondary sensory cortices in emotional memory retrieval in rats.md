# Summary
Are sensory cortices required for storage and retrieval of remote memory?
Previously, has been shown that lesions of sensory cortices fail to prevent emotional memory formation and recall if done prior or shortly after learning. But lesions during remote memory recall were untested. So they were tested here at remote time points, in modality specific behaviors.

[[Sensory association cortices encode learned associations of stimuli]]. Separate from stimulus memory per se.

# Key points
* Primary auditory cortex lesions 1 month after auditory FC has no effect on recall.
 ![[Association cortex is required for recall of cued fear memory but not acquisition]]

* Piriform cortex lesion 1 month after olfactory FC disrupts recall, but not new learning
* Association cortex effects are largely modality specific. 
	* lesion of secondary auditory cortex produces mild deficit with visual FC recall.
* Lesion of association cortex does not impair modality specfiic stimulus habituation and response.
* Observed high levels of IEG zif268 in layers 2-4 of association cortex following recall
	* Cortex layers 2-4 receive high levels of cortico-coritical communication
* Visual cue was a fluorescent bulb, 12 W, hung 20cm above arena

# Open questions
* what activity is driving the layer 2-4 increase? Good chance its PFC
* lesioned animals were able to exhibit new recent memories, but could they recall new remote memories??
