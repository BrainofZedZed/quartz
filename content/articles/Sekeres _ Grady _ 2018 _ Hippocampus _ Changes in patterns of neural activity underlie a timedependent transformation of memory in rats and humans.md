Overall shows that [[hippocampus]] activity continues to support episodic memory, supporting the idea that the nature of the memory (ie the vividness) rather than the age determines the recruitment of the hippocampus. Unlike hippocampus, [[PFC]] activity is relatively insensitive to retrieval context and more dependent on age. Suggests that the memory represented in mPFC is not a copy of the original but a transformed, less vivid memory.

# Abstract
Known that episodic memories show a progressive loss of detail while schematic memories are retained, seen in humans and rodents (contextual memory). Hippocampal involvement is involved. But growing evidence suggests cortically-based memories are qualitatively different than hippocampal-based memories (Dudai 2012; Kanel 2014). This idea has basis in multiple trace theory and trace transformation theory (which describes a transformation process that allows for the representation of schematic memories in the neocortex)(Winocur and Moscovitch 2011). Sought to examine structures involved in generalization of contextual / episodic memories in rat and human.

# Key points
FIG 1 In rats, contextual fear memory generalizes (same context vs altered context) at remote but not recent timepoints. However, dorsal hippocampus cFos expression is still biased toward same context, suggesting hippocampal activity doesn't generalize. cFos expression in anterior cingulate is similarly high between same and altered contexts with in the same timepoint, but is greater at remote timepoints. 

FIG 2 Humans in fMRI watch film clip and have to retrieve memory, either immediately following (0d) or 7d later. Self-reported memory of story content and perceptual detail declined over time. Memory for peripheral (not reflecting schematic story content) declined more than central elements.

FIG 3 Retrieval related activity shifts over time. Hippocampal and parahippocampal area activity during recall declines, but does not disappear, over 7d. This occurs as mPFC activity increases over the same timespan. 

FIG 4 Specifically looked at memories that were recalled vividly, with little loss of detail, showed no difference in hippocampal actvitity between 0d and 7d.
