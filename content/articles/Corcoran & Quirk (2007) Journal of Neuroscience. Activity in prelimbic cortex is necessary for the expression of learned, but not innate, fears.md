# Summary
[[prelimbic]] cortex is known to project to the [[basolateral amygdala]] and was known to NOT be necessary for acquisition of fear memory. But it's role in expression of fear memory was unknown.

![[Prelimbic is required for recall of learned fear.]]

* showed that SOM neurons in PL inhibited PV neurons, thereby disinhibiting PL projection neurons and facilitated fear memory expression

# Key points
[[prelimbic]] is required for expression of learned fear memory, whether that is tone conditioning or context conditioning, at 1d retrieval

# Open questions
* what downstream targets of PL are required for fear memory expression? 
* would effects of inactivation of PL be different if recall were at a later timepoint, instead of 1-day?
* generally, what is the function of PL in learned fear? Perhaps a contextual gating
* would this translate to a mouse?
