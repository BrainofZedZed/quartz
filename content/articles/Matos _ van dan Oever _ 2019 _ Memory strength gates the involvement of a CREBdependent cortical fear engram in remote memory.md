-PFC engram involved in learning is only reactivated during remote recall, not recent. This only applies to weak fear memory. Strong fear memory has no preferential involvement of PFC engrams. CREB in initial [[PFC]] engram, after initial learning, is required for proper consolidation/reactivation of PFC neurons for remote recall.
