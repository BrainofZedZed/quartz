# 1 Line
The Stress-induced Enhancement of Fear Learning (SEFL) model utilizes numerous (15) high-intensity (1mA) shocks over a prolonged period (1 hour) as a model for PTSD. This results in enhanced (contextual) fear-learning and pronounced freezing behavior.

# Summary
Two features of PTSD modeled in SEFL:  1) exaggerated reaction to a mild stressor / reminder of the orignal trauma, in which the reaction is more appropriate to the original trauma, 2) comorbid anxiety.

Animals pre-conditioned with 15 shocks may be sensitized to future shocks. The sensitization increases the ability of the shock to serve as a reinforcer for new fear learning

SEFL is robust to extinction. Even after contextual freezing response undergoes extinction, the enhancement of future fear learning remains

Systemic administraction of NMDAR antagonist APV does not prevent freezing response during pre-conditioning, nor does it prevent enhanced fear response during new fear learning

Enhancement of fear learning occurs independent of context in which trauma occurred (but still with mild shock as new learning)

After pre-conditioning in context A, then a tone+shock (16s tone, 85Hz) in Context B. Then were exposed to Context C. Animals receiving shocks in previous contexts had elevated freezing. Animals underwent extinction exposure (~10min a day), which resulted in similar baseline levels of freezing between shock and nonshock groups after 4-5 days. On tone recall, during the 16s tone, there was no elevated freezing between pre-conditioned and non-pre-conditioned groups. After the tone, pre-conditioned animals displayed more freezing. This indicates that pre-exposure doesn't heighten associative learning with one CS-US pairing, but does cause prolonged fear behavior


# Key points
There's heightened conditional freezing with regard to contextual freezing, but not with associative freezing per se

Observed individual variability in fear enhancement -- similar to behavioral profiling suggested in [[Richter-Levin...Schmidt (2019) Mol Psych. Animal models of PTSD: a challenge to be met]].

* suggests that a memory of a shock can link a tone and context. The SEFL-induced shock memory would be very strong, and probably link up to memories of future shocks, including ones paired with tones

# Open questions

* does SEFL enhance tone-shock recall  with more than one tone-shock pairing? 

* the data suggests that SEFL enhances freezing circuits and contextual-fear learning circuits. How would this affect cued fear conditioning circuits?
