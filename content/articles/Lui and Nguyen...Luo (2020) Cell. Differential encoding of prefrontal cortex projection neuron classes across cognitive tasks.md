# Summary
Examined layer 5 PFC projection neurons in PFC. Used single cell RNAseq to identify transcriptomic classes. Looked at correspondence between transcriptional classes, projection targets, and task encoding. One transcriptomic class corresponded with a projection class (PAG projecting). Others did not. 

Most transcriptomic classes projected to multiple targets, and most targets received projections from multiple classes. 

Different cell classes preferentially contribute to different aspects of task encoding, suggesting a basis for different transcriptomic classes to make a different contribution to behavior. But in the PFC, task information is so dispersed that there is little 1-to-1 correspondence of information, making it extremely complex.

# Key points
Contralaterally projecting PFC cells only weakly encode spatial information but strongly encode reward-context information.

Miniscope imaged [[prelimbic]] cells using 0.5mm GRIN lens. Did not aspirate. Used boundaries for PL:  AP 1.7 - 2.1, DV 1.9 - 2.6. That extends way beyond PL to me. 

To get really good fiber and lens histology, postfixed entire head, skull and brain intact, in PFA. Then removed skull. I should try that.
