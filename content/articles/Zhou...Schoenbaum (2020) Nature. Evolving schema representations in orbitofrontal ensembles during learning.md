# Summary
Trained rats to learn and perform an odor association task. Presented multiple "problems" with unique components (odors), but each problem had a common underlying structure.

Recorded from orbitofrontal cortex during task. Used canonical correlational analysis (CCA) to align dimensionality-reduced datasets across different problems or different animals. 

Similar to finding the pincipal components across tasks, or across animals on the same task, showing an underlying structure to the neural activity. Like PCA on PCA. "Canonical components describe the neural activities from each dataset within a common neural manifold. Higher correlation between a pair of CCs means better alignment of the two datasets in that dimension, consistent with more generalized neural representation".

Found evidence for canonical components evolving across time -- both across task and across animals -- demonstrating the generation and evolution of a neural schema.
