# Summary
Lesioned [[hippocampus]] 1, 7, 14, or 28d after cued (tone) fear memory. Tested recall after. Lesions 1 day after training lesions impaired contextual memory, but not later lesions. None of the lesions impaired cued recall.

# Key points
Lesioned most of the dorsal hippocampus.

[[Hippocampus is not required for consolidation or recall of cued fear memory.]]
