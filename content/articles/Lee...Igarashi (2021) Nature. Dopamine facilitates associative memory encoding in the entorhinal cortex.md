[[VTA]] dopamine projections to lateral entorhinal cortex layer II fan cells encode novelty and reward anticipation signals, which drive those fan cells to encode cue-reward association.

# Abstract
Dopamine is known to be involved in reward-reinforcement learning, as is entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, but their interaction is unknown. Using an olfactory cue-reward association task, showed that lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) fan cells encdoe cue-reward association. DA fibers from [[VTA]] signal novelty (new odor) and eventually shift to reward-prediction (signal in familiar odors only when reward is expected).
# Key points
FIG 1 Opto inhibition of LEC fan cells (which project to hippocampus) impair associative learning of new novel odors to rules based on previously learned odors, while recall of rules based on previously learned odors is unimpaired. In contrast, opto inhibition of pyramidal cells in the same LEC layer (which only project to cortex, not hippocampus) causes no impairment. Thereofre, LEC fan cells are necessary for associative learning. 

FIG 2 Fan cells encdoe specific cue-reward associations. Individual cells have pairing preferences. As a population vector, the PC space of paired odors grows more similar across learning. Fan cell activity was strongest during cue period and decayed over delay and reward periods, implying joint cue and taks information. On pre-learned associations, fan cell activity was sparse and similar or pre-learned odor retrieval, but grew more active with introduction of novel odor associated with reward odor (A), but weakly active with non-rewarded odor (B). 

FIG 3 Fiber photometry of VTA>LEC DA fibers. Inhibiting these optogenetically and pharmacologically impaired novel odor association. Fiber photometry results show little signal during AB trials after learning, but large signals when odor 1 and 2 were introduced. Signal for odor 2 eventually faded, but increased for odor A and remained high for odor 1. Data suggest these LED DA fibers initially carry novelty signal, then transition to reward expectation during learning 

FIG 4 Used opto-tag to record from LEC fan cells while inhibiting VTA fibers. Unilateral inhibition decreased correct response trials. PC analysis of recordings during control and inhibition trials showed that LEC cells failed to group A-1 odors during inhibition, as happens in controls. Separation of A-B odors in LEC encoding still occurred, pointing to a non-DAergic mechanism. Together, authors argue LEC inputs are required for establishing the representation of cue-reward association in LEC fan cells during associative learning

# Comments
Interpretation of fiber photometry a little tricky -- wished they showed more raw signals over trials
