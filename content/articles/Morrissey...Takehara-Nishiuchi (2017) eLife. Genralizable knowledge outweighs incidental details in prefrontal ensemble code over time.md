Over time, following two similar learning experiences, firing rates of [[prelimbic]] [[PFC]] neurons become less selective for physical features and more selective for common relational features -- aka latent variables.

# Abstract
Recording from rat [[prelimbic]], animals were trained on two distinct but structurally similar learning tasks. Associating either an auditory or visual signal with a mild electric shock to the eyelid. Trained on auditory (~80 times) then trained on visual cue in different context (~80 times).  Over learning, [[prelimbic]] neurons encoded physical features of context and cue. But over weeks, ensemble code encoded less physical feature information and more relational variable information. When introduced to a new environment with similar features previously learned, the relational-variable ensemble code was present.

# Key points
data argues that schematized (gist-like) knowledge is a product of [[PFC]] learning latent variables, rather than of simply forgetting details. Supports this with different timecourses of encdoing latent variables vs forgetting physical features

mPFC involved in memory assimilation. Theory suggests [[PFC]] selects most appropriate memory based on current context, then recruits [[hippocampus]] to recover contents of the memory. Initial selection likely relies on pattern completion in mPFC. Upon pattern completion in mPFC, projections to cortical structures recreate a gist-like experience, whereas projections to hippocampus facilitate acquisition of new information into memory, context, and latent variable extraction.

# Comments
- Is it that different neurons are active to shape the remote, latent-variable encoding than are active during the learning? Is the change in firing rate a reflection of the change in the same units over time, or a reflection of a recruitment of different units?
- What are the 'latent variables' in my fear conditioning experiment? What are the similar structures between the experiences (CS+ and CS-, shock context and altered context)
- Are latent variables similar to gist? Is gist more based on the context and rules, or more based in the approximate physical sensation?
- Used 'firing differentiation' to look at differences and similarities in response to stimuli. Broke down firing into consistency and magnitude. Could I use a simlar approach with calcium imaging?
