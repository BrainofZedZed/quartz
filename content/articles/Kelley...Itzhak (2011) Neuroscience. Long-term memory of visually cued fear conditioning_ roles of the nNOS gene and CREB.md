# Summary
nNOS signaling is important for fear conditioning. Investigated nNOS KO line in visual cue fear-conditioning paradigm.

Mice were fear conditioned using a light-based CS-US pairing, then tested for context and cue recall.

# Key points
* Visual cue was 1) removal of white light in corner of arena with simultaneous 2) appearance of yellow light in center. Brightness not indicated. Light blinked for 2s on/off
* Interestingly, reference for fear conditioning procedure references lab's previous paper, which used auditory cue. No explanation of justification of visual cue.
* After one CS-US pairing, animals froze at both 1d and 7d recall at both cue recall and context recall.
* After four pairings, freezing increased by ~20%.
* Found differences in nNOS KO mice recall in context vs cue recall.
