Age related loss happens at all frequencies. 3 and 6 kHz is a steady rate throughout lifespan, 12 Hz loss accelerates around 36 weeks, 24 kHz at 26 weeks,  32 kHz and 48 kHz at 16 and 12 weeks, respectively. 

12 Hz has lots of individual variability. 
For designing auditory experiments, sticking in the 3-6 kHz range is safest, while 3-9 kHz is probably fine.
