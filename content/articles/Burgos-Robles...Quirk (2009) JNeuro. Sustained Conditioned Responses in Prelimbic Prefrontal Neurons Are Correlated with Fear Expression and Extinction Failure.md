Sustained activity in [[prelimbic]] cortex correlates with freezing.

# Summary
Subjected rats to auditory fear conditioning with an early extinction (2hr later) and late extinction (24 hr later) period. Recorded single units in [[prelimbic]].

A subset of [[prelimbic]] neurons increased activity during conditioned tone presentation, and spiking activity correlated with freezing levels.

Upon extinction, tone no longer elicited increased firing.
