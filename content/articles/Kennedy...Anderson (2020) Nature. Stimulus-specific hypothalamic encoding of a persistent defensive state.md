# Summary
Previously unknown whether slow neural dynamics are involved in persistent internal emotional states and defensive behaviors. Dorsomedial and central subdivisions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHdm/c) are necessary for defensive behaviors, and can elicit behavior that outlasts the stimulus. Found that these neurons show stimulus-specific, slow and persistent activity in response to fear stimuli.

Fear behaviors like thigmotaxis and place aversion require the activity of these cells (silencing them disrupts behavior).

Miniscope imaging confirms persistent threat evoked activity and reveals stimulus specific neuronal encoding.

VMHdm/c activity is evoked by both predators and conspecifics in a lingering fashion (calcium traces have long decay kinetics).

VMHdm/c neurons also respond to auditory threat stimuli, again showing spectrum of responsiveness

Spectrum of responsiveness to different stimuli

Persistence of response to auditory stimulus is less than to a rat stimulus, suggesting a possible lingering odorant effect, or different persistence rates with different stimuli

Computational models of VMHdm/c activity suggest that spiking recurrent neural nets with very slow time constants, or sRNNs with medium time constants plus local connectivity, are key to persistence of activity
