# Summary
Did fluorogold injections into rat [[PFC]] -- either [[prelimbic]], [[infralimbic]], agranular, or anterior cingulate.

![[There is a dorsoventral gradient of afferents into PFC.]]

!!Related concepts
* [[Prelimbic and infralimbic cortex have opposing functions.]]
* [[PFC structures are a functional gradient.]]

# Key points
* Input is largely unilateral
* PL has dense input from:
1. other mPFC structures
2. [[basolateral amygdala]] and centrolateral amygdala
3. anterior midline thalamus
4.  ventral [[hippocampus]] CA1
5.  rostral PL injections had stronger input from [[hippocampus]], [[basolateral amygdala]], medial septum
* caudal PL injections had stronger input from basal forebrain

[[Prelimbic and infralimbic afferents]]

# Open questions
* Given the large overlap in afferents to PL and IL, how do they perform different functions? What are the key differences in the information they receive?
