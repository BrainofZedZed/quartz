How do representations of past experiences in the posterior parietal cortex interact with current sensory input? 
[[Parietal cortex]] ensembles are re-activated during recent context re-exposure and are involved in integrating present information with past experience via projections to [[anterior cingulate]]

# Abstract


# Key points
FIG 1: Cells (about 10%) in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are responsive to context exposure and re-exposure with immediate shock. 

FIG 2: PPC neurons are responsive to specific contexts. Inhibiting PPC neurons TRAPd during context exposure during re-exposure and immediate shock reduces context freezing. Inhibiting PPC neurons that were TRAPd during context exposure, during re-exposure, had no effect on motility (metric of familiarity). Targeting CA1 increased motility, suggesting CA1 stores memory of environment (note: better control would be to not do pre-exposure and still target CA1). 

FIG 3: TRAPd PPC cells active during Context A with ChR. Activated of those cell during immediate shock in Context B. Retrieved in Context A and C. Increased freezing in Context A. Overall suggests that PPC activation during immediate shock increases learning and strength of fear memory but doesn't indicate whether the TRAPd cells per se are requied, or just arbitary PPC activation. (would have been a good control to activate all PPC, not just TRAPd cells). 

FIG 4: TRAPd PPC cells during recall after pre-exposure of context followed by Immediate Shock. Inhibited them during another recall. Reduced freezing. During a following recall without inhibition, freezing returned. Suggests PPC ensemble needed for full memory recall. Feels like they were fishing for an extinction effect. If their theory holds, PPC would be involved in updating ensembles for extinction information. But would need a different paradigm. 

FIG 5: Inhibiting PPC cells TRAPd during context re-exposure after immediate shock, AFTER the context, reduced freezing to a future context re-exposure. Suggests that ongoing PPC activity re-consolidates memory after activation. 

FIG 6: Fos activity in BLA and ACC is modulated by activation or inhibition of of TRAPd PPC ensembles from Fig 5. Suggests BLA and AAC are downstream of PPC. 

FIG 7: Silencing PPC>AAC projections during immediate shock after context preexposure reduces recall freezing. Suggests PPC>AAC participates in learning.

# Comments
Missing some good controls. Narrative really overreaches results. Tries to make distinction betweem this ensemble and strictly engram cells.

>"However, our results indicate that the PPC ensemble function is distinct from that of the memory engram because silencing PPC ensemble activity had no effect on the recall of individual memories of context and fear. Thus, the cell ensemble in the PPC does not store pre-exposed context and IS memories but rather regulates the interaction between these memories."
