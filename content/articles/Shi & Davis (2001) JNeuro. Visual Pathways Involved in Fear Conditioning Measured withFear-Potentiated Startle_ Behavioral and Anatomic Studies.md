!!Summary
BACKGROUND

Pathways of auditory fear conditioning are well studied -- auditory inputs from thalamus and auditory association cortex project to lateral amygdala. Foot-shock US information can also be relayed either through thalamic or cortical routes.
 The routes of visual CS information in fear conditioning are unknown, however. 

Lesioning occipital cortex post-training does not prevent expression or extinction of visually cued fear. This indicates that non-occipital cortex routes relay visual info to the amygdala.

Post-training lesion of lateral geniculate (LG) and lateral posterior (LP) thalamic nucleus together, but not individually, prevented startle response, only with visual CS, not with olfactory CS or context.

Anterograde tracing from LP shows strong projections to BLA, as well as V2L, TE2, and perirhinal.

!!Key points

* Used fear-potentiated acoustic startle response as indicator of fear. Old school.
* TE2 is well connected to thalamic, amygdala, and cortical areas. 
* Indicates parallel cortical and subcortical pathways to convey visual CS info to amygdala, similar to auditory CS info. 

!!Open questions
* Are these two pathways -- cortical and subcortical -- functioning redundantly? Or do they carry unique information?
* Are each of these pathways sufficient for fear memory expression? Or are both required?
