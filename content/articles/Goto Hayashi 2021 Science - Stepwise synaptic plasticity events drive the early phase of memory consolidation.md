# Abstract
They developed a new optogenetic approach for erasing LTP at the spine level. - [[hippocampus]] LTP has 2 phases: 1) online LTP, immediately after learning - establishes selectivity of neuronal firing to the shock context, 2) offline LTP, during sleep - recruits neurons into synchronized bursts, which stabilizes nascent memory engram, 3) another phase during sleep the following day in the [[anterior cingulate]] Memory stability is linked to dendritic spines (Haruo Kasai 2017)

# Key points
 Fig 1 At low density, cofilin (CFL) severs F-actin, leading to disassembly. At high density, cofilin binds to actin, resulting in cofilactin which is stable. Inactivating CFL should destabilize cofilactin and 'erase' structural LTP (sLTP). Supernova (SN): a photosensitive protein used for chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI). When illuminated at 559nm, SN generates ROS (reactive oxygen species) that inactivates proteins it is fused to. Time window for CALI to reduce a spine is ~2min after artificually induces LTP (glutamate uncaging) until 30min. Ineffective after 50min. After that timepoint, other processes stabilize the actin that's building out the spine. 
 
 FIG 2 Optical erause of memory by CALI is context specific Inhibitory dark avoidance test. Light chamber, dark chamber, wants to go in dark chamber but gets shocked in there. If use CALI afterward in CA1 using transgenic mice, which shrinks newly formed spines, then next day memory is impaired. 
 
 FIG 3 Offline LTP in the hippocampus during sleep is required for memory Using closed loop EEG to monitor for sleep, doing CALI during sleep in the 2-8h after learning disrupts memory the next day. Doing CALI the next day is ineffective. Recorded CA1 using miniscopes during same task. Doing CALI prevented a small shift in context selectivity. 
 
 FIG 4 Large difference in PC space between Day1 and Day3 memory in control (shock, no CALI), whereas minimal difference for shock + CALI. Often activity, like synchronous events and spatial mapping, have a pattern after learning in control animals that is disrupted after CALI. FIG 5. ACC has an LTP time window distinct from that of the hippocampus. Doing CALI in ACC immediately after learning has no effect on memory. Doing it on Day 2 -- specifically during sleep -- disrupts memory.

Disruption of Day3 memory via [[anterior cingulate]] spine downregulation is strange. Would have expected remote, not intermediate, disruption. This is interesting. Contrast to Lee Han paper with [[temporal association cortex]] to [[basolateral amygdala]]. Maybe suggets that TeA>BLA is more 'first order' memory, rather than second order. Whereas PFC > TeA is likely the second order.
