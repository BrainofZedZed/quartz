# Summary
Known that [[prelimbic]] is necessary for recall of fear memory, including its projections to [[basolateral amygdala]]. 

But what controls [[prelimbic]] circuitry?

![[Prelimbic fear expression is controlled by local parvalbumin neurons]]

# Key points
* Some interneurons increased firing during CS+ while others decreased
* Inhibiting PL PV neurons induces freezing, both pre-fear conditioning and post-extinction
	* Activating PL PV neurons decreases freezing.
