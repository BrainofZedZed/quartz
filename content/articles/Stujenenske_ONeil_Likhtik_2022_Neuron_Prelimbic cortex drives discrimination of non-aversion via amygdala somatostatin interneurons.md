[[basolateral amygdala]] [[somatostatin]] neurons, driven by [[prelimbic]] input, repsond to learned non-threatening cues (CS-) and reduce synchronization in [[basolateral amygdala]] principal neurons

# Abstract
During fear conditioning, BLA PV neurons promote fear acquistion while SOM neurons impair fear acquisition. Their role during discrimination of non-theatening cues is unknown. Also unknown is whether discrimination is actively maintained or a passive process. BLA principal neurons remap to theatening cues (active)(Grewe 2017) but also discrimination learning recruits specific principal neurons and interneurons that prevent generalization (Grosso 2018). Used a three day auditory fear learning protocol. 2 and 8khz tones. 1s, 0.4mA shock. 6 CS+ and CS- on each training day. Tones were 50ms pips at 1Hz for 30s. Average 70% freezing to CS+. No freezing to CS-.

# Key points
FIG 1 - BLA SOM neurons increase activity during CS- retrieval. 
Recall session, only being exposed to CS+ or CS-, doing fos afterward in BLA. With CS- much more SOM neurons positive for fos, compared to with CS+, or with PV cells for CS+ or CS-. Fiber photometry shows SOM BLA cells increase activity with CS-, decrease activity with CS+. 

FIG 2 - BLA SOM neurons mediate discrimination by desynchronizing inputs to the amygdala during CS- 
Inhibiting BLA SOM during CS- increases freezing. Recording LFP from BLA and PL, CS+ shows high theta phase consistency, whereas CS- has low. Inhibiting BLA SOM during CS- increases phase consistency; no effect on CS+. 

FIG 3- BLA SOM activity depends on PL input 
Inhibiting PL via muscimol impairs discrimination between CS+ and CS- but doesn't impair CS+ freezing. !!!! BLA SOM neurons increase response to CS+ and decrease response to CS- after PL muscimol infusion. 

FIG 4 - Silencing PFC input to BLA allows syncronous cell-firing during CS- 
used taconic mice, which showed MUCH higher levels of generalization than C57 mice. Silencing PFC-to-BLA projections (using Arch) in mice that discriminated led to reduced discrimination and theta phase reset strength. Activating those projections in mice that generalized improved discrimination.
