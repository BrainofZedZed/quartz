# 1 Line
[[temporal association cortex]] is a necessary node in linking an auditory stimulus with affective value and recalling that affective value.

# Key points
Emotional learning has three stages: 1) memorization of sensory features of the CS and US ('perceptual learning'), 2) linking the CS and US ('S-S learning'), 3) association between the CS and the valence of the US ('associative learning')

[[Temporal association cortex is required for early consolidation of remote auditory fear memory.]]

Inactivating Te2 (TTX) in a sensory preconditioning paradigm does not disrupt freezing to CS2, suggesting that Te2 is not required for perceptual learning of Stimulus-Stimulus associative learning. 

Inactivating Te2 (TTX) in a second-order conditioning paradigm DOES disrupt freezing to CS2, suggesting Te2 is required to associate the affective property of a sensory cue with an auditory sensory cue 

Also show that Te2 is required to UPDATE existing affective properties of an auditory cue. Using appetitive conditioning, followed by re-conditioning to aversive US, then 24 hr later inactivating Te2 (both muscimold and TTX), the CS retained it's prior affective value. Saline injected animals switched the valence.

Lesioning Te2 impairs remote appetitive auditory memory, after pairing tone with food

Increasing the salience of the aversive quality has no effect on IEG activity in Te2

Te2 neurons are active following an affectively associated tone, but not following a neutral tone, indicating that they are 'associative value-coding' neurons

Lesion of Te2 remote-memory ensemble impairs remote memory. Associating two different tones with different quality USs (aversive, appetitive), then lesioning the remote-memory ensemble for the aversive stimulus, did not inpair recall of appetitive linked stimulus. This suggests that either different CSs have different Te2 ensembles, or Te2 ensembles are distinct in their affective encoding, or both 

* Earlier data showed that most cells are responsive to both appetitive and aversive conditioning

* distinction between CS+ and CS- ensemble present in TeA as well

# Open questions
is it just positive and negative valence is processed in different populations? Or does the distinction happen at the level of the stimulus? Would two different auditory CS, both paired with aversive US, be mediated by a seperate ensemble?
