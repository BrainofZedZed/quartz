### Direct evidence of PFC > association cortex control
Monkey dorsolateral [[PFC]] cooling reduced stimulus sensitivity during working memory period of inferotemporal neurons. This implicates PFC as having goal-oriented top-down control of association cortex.

Microstimulation of monkey frontal eye field (thought to be a source of top-down control to gate visual responses). Shortly following FEF stimulation, V4 neurons showed enhanced response to visual targets in their receptive field -- similar to the effect of attention. Strong evidence showing FEF modulates V4 signals.  [[Moore _ Armstrong _ 2003 _ Nature _ Selective gating of visual signals by microstimulation of frontal cortex|Moore & Armstrong 2003]]

By isolating top-down and bottom-up signals in a monkey using a posterior-specific split-brain procedure, in which stimulus information reached one hemisphere only via [[PFC]], saw stimulus-specific responses in inferotemporal cortex 170ms after stimulus presentation. This shows that PFC neurons were sufficient to trigger activation of object representation in ITC in a top-down manner.
