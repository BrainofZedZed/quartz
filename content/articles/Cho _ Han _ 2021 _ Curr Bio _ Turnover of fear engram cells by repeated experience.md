# 1 Line
Overall, suggests that repeated fear learning dissociates previously activated ensembles in favor of new ones (in [[basolateral amygdala]] ensembles during cued fear conditioning).

# Abstract
How is memory represented with repeated experiences across time? Two ideas: stable memory engram that is reactivated vs unstable engram. Unclear if different ensembles are recruited to support memory by repeated experience (in the LA, already shown to be spontaneous in PFC by [[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience. Temporal evolution of cortical ensembles promoting remote memory retrieval]]). Also unknown whether each experience leaves behind its own distinct trace.

# Key points
FIG 1 Engram cells labeled by original learning become unnecessary for memory retreival after retraining. Inhibiting LA TRAPd cells during 1d retrieval reduces freezing during tone. But reconditioning the animals and then inhibiting the TRAPd LA cells from the original conditioning does not reduce freezig. This suggests that a new LA ensemble controling freezing is involved upon reexposure. 

FIG 2 Control experiments with stronger shock.

FIG 3 Original engram cells in LA have reduced connectivity following retraining. Original engram cells have increased mEPSC freq and spine density compared to non-engram cells. This increase is abolished with re-training. 

FIG 4 Original engram cells are less likely to be re-activated after reexposure following retraining. Fewer original engram cells show fos after retraining, compared to single exposure subjects. 

FIG 5 Despite all this, opto reactivation of original engram cells after re-training still drives freezing. Suggests that the original cells retain the ability to drive freezing #pattern-completion?) depsite having a reduced role in freezing. Vibes with idea of silent engram from [[Kitamura...Tonegawa (2017) Science. Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory]]

FIG 6 Adding a third memory experience, inhibiting engram cells from the second experience reduces freezing (while engram cells from the original experience do not), despite fewer cells being captured in second experience. Engram cells in the second reconditioning also have increased spine density compared to non-engram cells. 

FIG 7 Adding ANOTHER experience, inhibiting the second experience engram cells reduced freezing for a third experience but not for a fourth experience.
