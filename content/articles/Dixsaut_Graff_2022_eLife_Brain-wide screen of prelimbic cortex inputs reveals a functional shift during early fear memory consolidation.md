# 1 Line
Used a rabies-based retrograde screen of inputs to [[prelimbic]] at different phases of contextual fear encoding or recall (recent (1d) and remote (14d)), identifying a novel role for the [[claustrum]] projections to prelimbic during encoding and [[insula]] projections to prelimbic at recent recall.

Overall identifies a spatio-temporal shift in PL inputs important throughout memory consolidation.

# Abstract
Memory formation and storage rely on multiple interconnected brain areas, the contri- bution of which varies during memory consolidation. The medial prefrontal cortex, in particular the prelimbic cortex (PL), was traditionally found to be involved in remote memory storage, but recent evidence points toward its implication in early consolidation as well. Nevertheless, the inputs to the PL governing these dynamics remain unknown. Here, we first performed a brain-wide, rabies-based retrograde tracing screen of PL engram cells activated during contextual fear memory formation in male mice to identify relevant PL input regions. Next, we assessed the specific activity pattern of these inputs across different phases of memory consolidation, from fear memory encoding to recent and remote memory recall. Using projection-specific chemogenetic inhibition, we then tested their functional role in memory consolidation, which revealed a hitherto unknown contribution of claus- trum to PL inputs at encoding, and of insular cortex to PL inputs at recent memory recall. Both of these inputs further impacted how PL engram cells were reactivated at memory recall, testifying to their relevance for establishing a memory trace in the PL. Collectively, these data identify a spatio- temporal shift in PL inputs important for early memory consolidation, and thereby help to refine the working model of memory formation.

# Key points
- PL has major inputs from across [[PFC]], including [[anterior cingulate]], [[prelimbic]], and [[infralimbic]]. 
- Other major inputs:  [[orbitofrontal]], [[insula]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], [[tenia tecta]], [[hippocampus]] CA1, [[claustrum]], [[basolateral amygdala]], [[polymodal association thalamus]] (DORpm), [[dorsal peduncular]]
- Inhibiting [[basolateral amygdala]]>[[prelimbic]] neurons or [[entorhinal cortex]]>[[prelimbic]] neurons during encoding lead to deficit only at remote memory, not recent memory. Maybe this suggests that silencing specific inputs to PL, but not PL entirely, leads to impaired remote memory expression as the memory shifts to a cortical representation in PL that then 
-  >At remote memory, did not observe any PL input that was engaged or behaviorally relevant. None have been reported. "This apparent gap, or the impossibility to trace back the flow of information upstream of the mPFC, could be explained if the inputs are distributed across a vast network after memory consolidation. In that case, they could potentially be redundant and therefore harder to functionally identify. As such, these results are in agreement with the [[multiple trace theory]]

>We found that the reactivation of PL engram cells significantly correlated with freezing behavior, but only when the CLA and INS inputs were inhibited, and not in controls. When the CLA>PL projection is inhibited at encoding, or when the INS>PLprojectionis inhibited at recent recall, overall engram reactivation is left unchanged, but recent memory expression is impaired, which would suggest that the PL engram population itself is not required for recent memory recall. Since upon inhibition we observe the emergence of acorrelation between PL engram cells reactivation and memory retention, it is possiblethat CLA and INS inputs target inhibitory neurons in the PL, which normally prevent engram reactivation during recent recall, thus allowing the PL engramcellsto stay functionally silent.Releasing this inhibition could perturb normal memory expression, explaining the observed memory impairment at recent recall. Supports the idea of silent engram cells

# Comments
Lots of input from dorsal peduncular. Never heard of it before.
