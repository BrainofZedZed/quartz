Inactivation of dorsal [[hippocampus]] during auditory cued fear conditioning disrupts remote, but not recent, cued recall.

# Abstract


# Key points
FIG 1: muscimol inactivation of bilateral dorsal hippocampus during cued fear conditioning disrupts recent contextual recall (1d), but not recent cued recall (2d).

FIG 2:  muscimol during training impairs remote (20d) recall with either 'weak' (six pairings) or 'strong' (twelve pairings). Muscimol delivered prior to 20d recall (and not during training) did not impair performance.

FIG 3: Recent (1d) re-exposure to cue after muscimol-training rescues (mostly) remote cued fear memory.

FIG 4: Altered context re-exposure is insufficient to restore remote. Requires cue.
- interesting effect here in re-exposure rescuing memory. Wonder if that effect is hippocampal dependent or not. Would guess not. 

FIG 5: Same context re-exposure (1d) is insufficient to restore remote memory.

Supports the idea that [[the hippocampus is involved in cued fear conditioning]].
Is one of the [[Failures in systems consolidation theory]]
