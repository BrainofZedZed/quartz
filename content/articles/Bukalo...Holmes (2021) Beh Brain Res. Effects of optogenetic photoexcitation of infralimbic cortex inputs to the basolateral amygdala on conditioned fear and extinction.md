# Summary
[[infralimbic]] --> [[basolateral amygdala]] glutamatergic projections known to facilitate extinction. Does opto modulation during extinction training faciliatate extinction?

Infected IL with ChR at different titers. Did cued fear conditioning. During extinction training, did light stim. High titer of virus facilitated extinction.
