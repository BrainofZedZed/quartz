# 1 Line
[[basolateral amygdala]] principal neurons -- as a population -- are similarly active for both recent and remote fear memory.

# Abstract
Question:  are BLA principal neurons involved in recent and remote fear memory for conditioned auditory stimuli?

# Key points
FIG 1 - recent and remote retrieval shows similar freezing levels (though remote trends lower) when tested between animals, and both induce similar cfos expression in BLA 

FIG 2 - recent and remote freezing is similar when tested within animals. Microelectrode recording of BLA neurons shows similar activity at recent and remote timepoints. 

FIG 3 - within animals that are dual conditioned to recent and remote tones, freezing is similar for recent and remote memories (two different tones, two different contexts). Fiber photometry recordings from BLA excitatory neurons show similar activity for recent and remote tones. 

FIG 4 - opto inhibition of BLA principal cells reduces freezing to both recent and remote fear memory tones. 

FIG 5 - opto excitation of BLA PV cells reduces freezing to remote fear memory tone.

	- shows that repeated exposure to fear event changes which [[basolateral amygdala]] neurons are activated. Aligns with this paper in that [[basolateral amygdala]] is active for all fear memory, but the specific cells which are active may change.

# Comments
Used an innovative CS design with two different conditioning sessions in two different contexts to two different tones, 2 weeks apart. Allowed for testing of recent and remote memories (supposedly) without interference.

Also possible that memories weren't as separate as hoped, and that US of second memory  re-activated memory of first CS-US, including the [[basolateral amygdala]] ensemble, which then caused the memories to co-allocate to similar ensembles. Would need to test with a completely different fear conditioning paradigm, not involving shock, and not even involving tone for that.
