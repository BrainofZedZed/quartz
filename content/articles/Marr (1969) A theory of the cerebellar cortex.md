Foundational paper on the theory of the cerebellar cortex and its role in information processing

Proposes that the mossy fiber - granule cell arrangement acts as a pattern separator (via the widespread, dispersed mossy fiber input to the many different granule cells), 
and granule cell - [[Purkinje cell]] arrangement (in that they need ~200 coincident parallel fiber synapses to activate) acts as pattern recognition.

Parallels the [[hippocampus]] in the dentate gyrus -- with it's granule cells -- acting as a pattern separator, and CA regions acting as pattern recognition.
