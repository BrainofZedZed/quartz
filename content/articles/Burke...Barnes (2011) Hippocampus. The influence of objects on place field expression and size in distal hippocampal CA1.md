# Summary
Recorded from distal CA1 in rats (close to subiculum), an area which receives lateral [[entorhinal cortex]] input, as well as perirhinal input. Had animals run on a circular track, adding or removing objects along the track. The presence of objects affected the spatial map, producing more [[place cells]], tighter place cells, and alterations to objects led to partial remapping.

# Key points
*recorded in //distal// CA1, close to subiculum, in intermediate [[hippocampus]]
**related to [[Strange...Moser (2014) Nature Reviews Neuroscience. Functional organization of the hippocampal long axis]]
**this partially overlaps with where the miniscope likely recorded from in the HippoBellum data
*suggests that space with objects is more densely represented in just about every way
**more place fields (increased mean number of place fields per neuron)
**smaller place fields (decrease in mean place field size)
**more place cells (increased probability of a cell to express a place field)
*presence of objects decreases proportion of large (<75cm) place fields, increased proportion of small (<40cm) place fields
*had ~35% of recorded cells express place fields (compares to ~10% in my HippoBellum recordings)
