# Summary
The idea of schemas -- mental models -- as frameworks for information, memory, and recall is established in the psychology field but little investigation of its neurobiology has been done.

The authors use rats in a paired-associated task to demonstrate that learning a schema (gradually, over time) enables the rapid consolidation of new information, as tested by lesioning the hippocampus at different time intervals after (and before) learning.

Demonstrates that previous knowledge / expectations influence the rate of consolidation. Suggests that an initial mental map / schema is slow to generate, but then can act as a framework to rapidly incorporate new information.

Rats well-trained (~1 month) on paired-association task (uses flavors and locations for pairing). Over training, rats perform better and better. Lesions to [[hippocampus]] prevent learning.

After learning the schema / task organization, rats can quickly incorporate new place-associations into the schema.

Lesioning of the [[hippocampus]] two days after learning did not affect memory; suggests that [[systems consolidation]] happened within 48 hr

Rats with [[hippocampus]] lesions created 48 hr after learning final new paired association could, then trained on new arena (which they couldn't learn), retrained the memory 4 months later

Lesioning at 3 hours post learning, but not 48 hours, impaired memory.

Learning one schema had no effect on the acquisition of a different map, but did slightly interfere with the original schema memory

Comparing a static environment to a changing environment, that static environment promoted incorporation of new associations into the schema, but the changing environment did not, despite exposure to the new information for similar lengths of time

Consistent environment promoted memory retention whereas the inconsistent environment actively reduced memory retention, as if the inconsistent environment had taught animals to not expect to learn.
This, in itself, is learning.

# Open questions
* what is the minimal amount of time needed for consolidation to occur?  (> 3 hr; < 48 hr)
* why was there no carryover effect in the new schema? Presumably there's some sort of meta-schema in which the animal learns the logic / structure of the task.
