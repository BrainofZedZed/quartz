# Summary

PFC (mostly [[prelimbic]]) memory engram cells for CFC were rapidly formed during day 1 training through inputs from both the MEC-Va and the [[basolateral amygdala]], but they were not retrievable with natural recall cues -- ie exposure to the context -- they matured during the subsequent few weeks, and this process required inputs from hippocampus engram cells, presumably through the MEC-PFC.

# Key points
* CFC increases cFos expression in PFC.
* MEC --> PFC terminal inhibition during CFC prevented PFC increase in cFos.

* MEC input drives cFos expresion in PFC during CFC.

* TRAPd PFC cells with ChR during CFC. Avitvating that group at 4 hz -- but not 20 hz -- drove freezing at 2d and 12d in unconditioned context.

* PFC CFC acquisition engram is sufficient to drive freezing at recent and mid-remote (12d) timepoints.
* TRAPd PFC cells during CFC with GFP, then looked at reactivation (via cfos) during recall at recent (2d) and remote (13 day) timepoints. 2day reactivation rates were at chance to different context, while 13day reacitvation rates were greater. 

* Original ensemble in CFC during acquisition is inactive during recent memory, but active during remote memory. 
*	However, only looked at activity via cFos promoter. Maybe other activity markers -- like npas4 -- are in play.


* somatic inhibition of CFC acquisition TRAPd cells during recent recall (2d) had no effect; but impaired recall during remote recall (12d).
	* Effect isn't huge though.

* Miniscope imaging of PFC cells (approximately PL area) revealed nuanced results. The average ca++ event frequency of PFC cells did not change between context. 
	* However, 11% of cells were footshock responsive. Those cells were less active in baseline contexts prior to footshock. 
* During remote (15d) but not recent (1d) recall, shock responsive cells showed elevated activity in FC context compared to non-FC context. 
	* Suggests that PFC shock responsive cells may be part of the remote memory engram.

* Inibhiting BLA terminals in PFC during CFC prevented increase in cFos expression, and slightly impaired remote (22d) recall, but not recent or semi-remote (2d, 8d, or 15d).
* constitutively inhibiting DG cells TRAPd during CFC prevented PFC engram cell reacitvation at remote (12 d) recall

* constitutively inhibiting DG cells TRAPd during CFC prevented PFC engram cell reacitvation at remote (12d) but not recent (2d) recall

* CFC TRAPd DG cells exposed to CFC context were active at recent (2d) but not remote (13d) timepoints.

* Opto reactivation of DG cells TRAPd during CFC oculd induce freezing at both recent (5d) and remote (15d)

* Inhibiting MEC --> BLA projections impaired recent (2d, 8d) but not remote (15d, 22d) CFC recall

*Inhibiting BLA --> PFC projections impaired remote (12d) but not recent (2d) CFC recall
