title: Cambiaghi...Sacchetti (2017) Front. Behav. Neurosci. Reversible Inactivation of the Higher Order Auditory Cortex during Fear Memory Consolidation Prevents Memory-Related Activity in the Basolateral Amygdala during Remote Memory Retrieval

methods: auditory fear conditioning, in vivo pharmacology (TTX), in vivo ephys, IEG IHC
species: rats
tags: #association-cortex #fear-memory #remote-memory #systems-consolidation #TeA #F32

# Summary
Inactivating [[temporal association cortex]] for ~8 hours one day after fear memory acquisition prevented [[remote memory]] expression.

Fear conditioned rats with an auditory cue, then 24 hr later reversibly inactivated [[temporal association cortex]] using tetrototoxin (which lasts for ~8 hours). 

At remote recall 30 days later, little evidence for fear memory. Lack of freezing, lack of synchrony between TeA and [[basolateral amygdala]] following cue presentation (synchrony observed ~3 Hz), and lack of increased IEG (Zif) expression in lateral and central amygdala.
