TH-positive [[VTA]] neurons respond to shock, but only medial populations respond to unexpected shock omission and correlate with learned behavior.

# Abstract
>We studied the role of dopamine TH neurons in the rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) in safety learning. First, we used an AX+/BX-discrimination procedure to establish conditioned stimulus (CS) B as a learned safety signal that passed both summation and retardation tests of conditioned inhibition. Then, we combined this procedure with ﬁber photometry in TH-Cre rats to study the activity of VTA dopamine neurons during safety learning. We show that whereas footshock is associated with calcium transients in TH neurons across the VTA, shock omission during safety learning is selectively associated with calcium transients in dopamine neurons in the medial but not lateral VTA. Moreover, the magnitude of medial VTA calcium transients during shock omission accurately predicts the amount of safety that is learned and expressed during summation testing. Our ﬁndings are consistent with a common medial VTA dopamine mechanism contributing to the learned inhibition of fear in extinction and safety.

# Key points
>VTA DA neurons are excited by an expected shock omission (Cai 2022, de Jong 2019, Salinas-Hernandez 2018) and this excitation is necessary for fear extinction learning because inhibiting VTA(TH) eruons at the time of shock omission impairs extinction

>whether VTA(TH) neurons are responsive to shock and shock omission during the learning of safety and how this activity relates to safety learning is unknown

>We show that VTATH neurons are excited by shock and also shock omission but that the precise proﬁle of TH neuron activity during learning differs across the medial-lateral axis of the VTA

>we show that the magnitude of the VTATH neuron response to the omission of shock predicts the amount of safety that is learned.

>ﬁndings in mice showing that activity of mVTA dopamine neurons during shock omission in fear extinction predicts the amount of extinction learned and with ﬁndings that optogenetic inhibition of these neurons during shock omission impairs fear extinction learning

>According to this interpretation, mVTA during shock omission reﬂects the teaching signal that instructs fear loss and this teaching signal is common to both fear extinction and safety. This conclusion is appealing. However, it remains to be adequately tested

# Comments
Good references on VTA activity, fear conditioning, shock, and shock omission. Seems like mostly mesolimbic though.
