# Summary
Memories undergo consolidation via synchronous reactivation of experience ensemble, observed across cortex, amygdala, hippocampus (including [[PFC]]). Reconsolidation process is thought to strengthen the connections between task-relevant neurons while weakening all others.

Circuit level effects of reactivation not fully understood.

After learning task, observed "brief" reactivation of activity patterns matchintg stimulus evoked activity. Synchronized with hippocampal ripples.
Rate of reactivation higher early in learning, predicted behavioral improvement.
Reactivated cells had "bidirectional changes" to functional connectivity the next day. Suggests different kinds of reactivation events -- those involving reward strengthen network connectivity, while those not involving reward weaken connectivity.

# Key points
* Spontaneous reactivation events in [[lateral visual association cortex]] occur during quiet waking.
* Reactivation events are more frequent during learning, and predict improvement in behavior.
* Reactivation events involving reward-encoding cells tend to strengthen their connectivity. 
* Reactivation events NOT involving reward-encoding cells tend to weaken their connectivity.
* Ensemble membership in a given reactivation event is plastic and changes over time.
* Reactivation events occur with neurons across functional categories.

# Open questions
* Is cortical reactivation events in a non-hippocampal dependent visual discrimination task reliant upon [[hippocampus]] sharp wave ripples?
* Is the strengthening and weakening of connectivity to local changes within the network or changes from common inputs?
