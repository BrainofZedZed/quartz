# Summary
Associative fear conditioning induces LTP in BLA, but not HC. Put a miniscope in the BLA and did tone-cued fear conditioning, with recall and exticntion. It's known how single-cell dynamics and plasticity work, but not how population ensemble dynamics work.

CS+ encoding changed after FC. Different populations encoded CS+ before and after FC. 
CS- encoding remained stable.
Some cells encoded states of the CS -- either the start, or the end, but most were stable.

Were able to train an accurate decoder to determine CS+ or CS- based on population data.
CS+ decoder training either pre or post FC was accurate, but decoding between FC was not accurate. Inidicates that the ensemble representation.
After FC, the population vector distance between CS+ and US grew more similar. But PVD between CS- and US remained the same. 

During extinction training, CS+ PVD grows more similar to original representation and less similar to US, but doesn't revert to original form.

The similarlity of the CS+ and US representations correlates with freezing.
