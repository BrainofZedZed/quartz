Distinct populations of [[basolateral amygdala]] neurons (technically basal amygdala) respond to fear-associated tones before and after extinguishing, with [[basolateral amygdala]] activity being necessary to acquire extinction.

# Abstract
Distinct and discrete populations of amygdalar neurons mediate states of high and low fear. These populations are thought to integrate sensory and contextual information. These populations are differently connected with the hippocampus and mPFC. Switching balance of these circuits drives behavioral transition between high and low fear states without being necessary for storage or behavioral expression of fear memory.

# Key points
FIG 1 Fear conditioned mice and recorded single units in BLA. Some neurons responded to tone on day 1 recall. Others did not respond to recall tone, but responded to tone after fear memory was extinguished. 

FIG 2 Similar to Fig 1, except there were two different CS+. Both associated with US. Only one was extinguished. Some neurons ('extinction neurons') responded only to the CS that was extinguished. 

FIG 3 Over the course of extinction learning, changes in extinction neurons precede changes in fear neurons, with changes in behavior following after. This suggests that behavioral changes are driven by sequential changes in distinct neuronal circuits. 

FIG 4 Returning mice to their learning context after extinguishing in an altered context renewed the fear beahvior in parallel with returning the activity of fear and exticntion neurons to their pre-extinction state. 

FIG 5 Using extracellular stimulation (orthodromic and antidromic spiking), fear neurons received input from ventral hippocampus and projected to mPFC, while extinction neurons had no input from hippocampus and had extensive bidirectional connections with mPFC. 

FIG 6 Inactivating BA (BA) with muscimol during extinction training prevented prevented extinction acquisition both day of and the following day, after the muscimol had washed out. Similarly, muscimol application also prevented renewal of an extinguished fear memory when put back into the learning context. As a control, inactivated BA during normal retrieval and found no effect. Together, data suggests that BA neurons are necessary for switching between fear states, but not acquiring new fear nor recalled previously learned fear
