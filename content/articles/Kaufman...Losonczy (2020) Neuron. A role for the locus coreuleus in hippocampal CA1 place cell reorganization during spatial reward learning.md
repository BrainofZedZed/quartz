# Summary

Used 2P calcium imaging on head-fixed mice on a treadmill, expressing ~GCaMP in [[locus coeruleus]], imaging their projections into CA1. Mice were trained on a reward location. LC-CA1 projections increased in activity near reward locations. Opto stim of those projections led to more place fields at the reward location (overrepresentation). Inhibition led to suppression of place cell overrepresentation. BUT this works only at a real reward site, and only during learning a task. LC-CA1 is necessary for proper reward zone representation but not sufficient, needing to work in conjunction with other cues.

# Key points
Place cells are enriched at goal locations; this overrepresentation can be updated when the goal location changes

Stimulating LC-CA1 axons near goal location generates overrepresentation of that location (ie hyper-enrichment of place cells around goal)

Inhibiting LC-CA1 axons around reward zone reduces place cell enrichment of reward zone

Does NOT work if done after learning the reward zone, and also does NOT work without the presence of a reward

No effect when stim is not paired with reward zone; no effect in random foraging task; no effect on novel cue in environment
