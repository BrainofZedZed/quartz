!!Summary

!!Key points
* stim of PL TRAPd neurons led to much larger increase in cFos at 14d vs 1d retrieval in:
**anteromedial visual area
**posteromedial visual area
**anterolateral visual area
**supplemental somatosensory area
* did NOT have a significant change at [[temporal association cortex]]
**therefore either:
**# temporal association cortex doesn't have a significant change in PL input at 14d
**#changes to TeA aren't fully captured by cFos, implying modifications to inhibitory synapses
**#changes in cFos expression at 14d are unimportant (unlikely)
