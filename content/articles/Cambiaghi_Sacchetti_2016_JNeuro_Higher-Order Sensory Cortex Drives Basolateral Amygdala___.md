# Summary
![[Association cortex synchronizes with amygdala during remote memory recall.]] Inactivating TeA during recall prevents BLA unit firing increase during cue presentation (almost seems as if BLA activity decreases when cue is presented without TeA).

Argues that TeA to BLA information transfer links conditioned stimulus with emotional valence. 

Does not convincingly show that TeA directly drives BLA for remote fear response though.
