During consolidation of an associative memory, [[PFC]] ([[prelimbic]]) activity becomes selective for learned associations. This occurs with over-training but is also retrained after months long break in training.

# Abstract


# Key points
>If, as these results suggest, memory is gradually consolidated in a network encompassing mPFC, then mPFC neurons should become selective for learned associations with a similar time course.

>Memories of associations between various elements of an event are presumed to be distributed over wide areas of cortex. The hippocampus may store a memory index for a unique array of neocortical modules representing each experiential event (22). Direct cortico-cortical connections that are gradually established during consolidation may render the hippocampal index codes for the original memory no longer necessary; alternatively, for certain forms of memory, the mPFC might take over the linking function from the hippocampus by storing a similar, but perhaps more efficient, index code (23). The observed selective activity for context-dependent, crossmodal associations in the mPFC is a critical prerequisite for the mPFC to function as a storage site of memory indices for consolidated memory. The role of the mPFC in the retrieval of consolidated memory may thus parallel the putative role of the hippocampus in retrieving recently formed memories, by completing the intercortical neural pattern from a partial cue.
