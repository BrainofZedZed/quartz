2P imaging of dm[[PFC]] neurons during cued fear conditioning shows emergence of CS+ ensemble that increases behavior decoding accuracy and within-network connectivity. This CS+ ensemble incorporates US-responsive cells, suggesting the US-responsive ensemble forms a foundation for the CS+ responsive ensemble. 

# Abstract


# Key points
FIG 1 - validation of cued fear conditioning during 2P imaging. The shock delivered was highly variably and seemed manually titrated to produce a specific behavioral response. 

FIG 2 - extaction of individual cell responses to CS+ and CS-. Compared first three presentations of the stimuli on 1d retrieval. Found that the Conditioned Response Ensemble could pretty accurately decode freezing. 

FIG 3 - compared across two ensembles: one taken from regular locomotion and one from the conditioned response. Comparing decoder performance at early training to early recall, the regular locomotor ensemble (RLE) had worse performance while the CS+ was presented. Similarly, the conditioned response ensembe (CRE) had better decoding performance during the CS+ than regular locomotion

FIG 4- the conditioned response ensemble increased within network connectivity from learning to recall. CR ensemble cells were more likely to be US responsive cells than non CR cells.

  

Overall suggests that dmPFC networks emerge and evolve during fear conditioning, with US responsive cells forming a core for CS+ ensembles to build upon.
