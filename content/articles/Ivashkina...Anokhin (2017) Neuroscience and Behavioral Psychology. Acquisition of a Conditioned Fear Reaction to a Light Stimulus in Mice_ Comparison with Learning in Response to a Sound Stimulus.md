!!Summary
Cued fear conditioning usually associates a tone (CS) with a shock (UCS). Other modalities are not well studiesd. Can a visual stimulus work as the CS?

Yes.

This was paper was pointless and dumb and a waste of 300 (!) mice.

!!Key points
* Mice are able to associate visual CS with shock basically as well as with auditory stimulus.
* 5 Hz light stimulus was more effective than on-off light stimulus
* With auditory cue, it took only one CS-US pairing for association to occur. With visual cue, it took two. 

!!Open questions
* Everything. What mechanisms are similar? What overlap? Is the difference in acquisition time meaningful?
