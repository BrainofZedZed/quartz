# Summary
Trained rats on food association paradigm, known to be [[hippocampus]] dependent. Inactivated dorsal HC or orbitofrontal cortex during different consolidation periods and examined early or remote memory. Utilized cfos to show corresponding changes in activity in these regions. 

Inactivating HC early (0 - 12 d) but not late (15 - 27 d) disrupted remote memory. Inactivating OFC both early and late disrupted learning.

Inactivating OFC on learning day disrupted remote memory (30 d) but not recent memory (7 d).
NMDA antagonist AP5 infused into OFC also blocked remote memory.

# Key points
* of interest:  this scoops the basic idea of Kitamura (2017)'s "immature cortical engram". In fact, it's not that novel. Been predicted a while.
