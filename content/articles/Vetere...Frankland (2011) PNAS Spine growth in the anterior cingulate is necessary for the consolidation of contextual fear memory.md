Blocking dendritic spine growth in the [[anterior cingulate]] during early consolidation, but not late, following contextual fear conditioning prevented subsequent memory expression.

# Abstract
Remodeling of cortical connectivity is thought to allow initially hippocampus-dependent memories to be expressed independently of the hippocampus at remote time points. Consistent with this, consolidation of a contextual fear memory is associated with dendritic spine growth in neurons of the [[anterior cingulate]] cortex (aCC). To directly test whether such cortical structural remodeling is necessary for memory consolidation, we disrupted spine growth in the aCC at different times following contextual fear conditioning in mice. We took advantage of previous studies showing that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) negatively regulates spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We found that increasing MEF2-dependent transcription in the aCC during a critical posttraining window (but not at later time points) blocked both the consolidation-associated dendritic spine growth and subsequent memory expression. Together, these data strengthen the causal link between cortical structural remodeling and memory consolidation and, further, identify MEF2 as a key regulator of these processes.

# Key points
Spine growth in later 2/3 and layer 5 [[anterior cingulate]] is necessary early in consolidation for later contextual fear memory expression. Used Golgi-Cox staining to stain cells, and a 100x objective to count them.
