# Summary
Stimulus identity and stimulus outcomes/associations are both salient features. But stimulus outcome associations are frequently changed, while stimulus identity stays the same.

Most investigation has focused on encoding of just stimulus identity or just stimulus outcome, not both, in a given brain region. It is unclear if ensembles encoding stimulus identity and outcome are separate or overlapping.

Investigated [[postrhinal cortex]] (POR) and [[lateral visual association cortex]] (LVAC). Some functional (lesion) and anatomical (input from VIS1 and BLA) evidence linking it to invovlement in reward. POR is retinotopically organized and encodes low level visual stimulus features. Also known that POR neurons encode saliency, as shown in a hunger-dependent effect on cues that predict food. But not known if overlapping populations encode stimulus identity or stimulus saliency.

LVAC neurons encode stimulus associations.

# Key points
*Mice can learn a visual discrimination task, which is dependent on POR
* Using 2P imaging during association learning and reversal, LVAC neurons have different response biases. Some neurons respond to outcome, regardless of stimulus; some respond to stimulus, regardless of outcome; some are broadly tuned to all visual stimuli.
*Tracked ~700 neurons (across 4 animals), of which ~150 were significantly responsive both pre- and post-reversal learning. ~25% responded to predicted outcome; ~25% 'broadly tuned'; ~50% to just stimulus.
**Of those responsive, ~25% across groups were responsive to both stimulus identity and outcome
** Some neurons are not responsive during learning of task, but develop outcome-sensitivity upon reversal learning
*** emphasizes that the outcome-tracking ensemble is plastic
*** similar features found when looking at single session data:  neurons transiently encoded outcome
* Comparing within versus across group co-changes in activity (i.e. noise correlations) is a way to infer distinct ensembles. 
**Reveals that outcome predicting and broadly tuned neurons have elevated within-group noise correlations, suggesting they have distinct input or connectivity. 


# Open questions
* are there differences in encoding hedonic (food) versus aversive (quinine) stimulus?
* how do [[PFC]] projections modulate this response?
* why exactly does a higher order visual area strongly encode low-level stimuli?
