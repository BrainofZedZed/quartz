>In the 70 ms following the FEF stimulation, neurons in V4 with corresponding retinotopy exhibited enhanced responses to visual targets within their receptive field. This increase in the gain of visual neurons mirrors the effect of attention on these neurons and provides strong causal evidence that activity in FEF neurons can directly modulate V4 signals in a top-down manner.
