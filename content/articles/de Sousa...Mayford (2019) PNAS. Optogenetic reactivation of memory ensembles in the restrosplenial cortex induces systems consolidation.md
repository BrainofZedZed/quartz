# Summary
In [[systems consolidation]], spontaneous reactivation of the memory ensemble is an idea that's never been tested. There is correlational evidence showing resting ensemble-reactivation, and disrupting gamma bursts disrupts impairs (spatial) memory, but nothing directly linking ensemble reactivation with systems consolidation. 

TRAPd neurons during CFC with ~ChR, then targeted light to retrosplenial cortex posttraining. Used a high frequency stim protocol known to induce LTP in vivo. Observed similar features to physiological reconsolidation only if activation occured during light anesthesia or sleep.

# Key points

Inactivation of [[hippocampus]] did not disrupt memory for RSC ensemble stim group, but it did disrupt memory for no stim group; this suggests that reactivating [[retrosplenial cortex]] ensemble creates memory independence from the hippocampus.

[[hippocampus]] independence at 24 hr CFC recall only worked if the [[retrosplenial cortex]] reactivation occurred during light anesthesia or sleep, not wakefulness.

LFP recordings across the brain showed that responses to [[retrosplenial cortex]] stimulation depended on brain state (awake vs anesthesia vs sleep).

Reactivation of [[retrosplenial cortex]] ensemble led to context generalization 24 hour post training, while controls still discriminated. Controls at 30 days post training showed context generalization, suggesting that the RST stim effects mimicked physiological consolidation mechanisms but at a faster time scale.

Posttraining, high frequenct stimulation of [[restrosplenial cortex]] ensemble TRAPd during CFC produces a recent memory with behavioral and neural characteristics of a remote memory
