# Summary
Fear conditioned animals using 3 CS-US pairings of a 0.75mA, 2s co-terminating shock with a roating visual grating, 30s stim. 12 hr later, sleep improves discrimination of CS+ and CS-, mostly by increasing response to CS+. CS- response stays similar, compared to sleep deprived mice

Opto-TRAPing cells responsive to visual stimulus, then activating those V1 cells in place of CS, and pairing with US, is MILDLY effective at pairing CS with US
- pairing CS with US, THEN activating those opto-TRAPd cells in novel context has LARGE effect on freezing

Activating opto-TRAPd V1 neurons with a train alters population coding and biases representation of opto-tagged neurons

Conversely, inhibiting opto-TRAPd V1 neurons during sleep diminishes discrimination

* also has large, nonspecific effect to increase freezing
