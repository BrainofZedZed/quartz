Rabies-mediated retrograde tracing from two [[prelimbic]] projection neuron populations (PL>NAc and PL>rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg)) reveals overlapping but differently weighted afferents, both emphasizing PL and IL input.

# Abstract
Using TRIO [[Schwarz...Luo (2015) Nature. Viral genetic tracing of the input-output organization of a central noradrenaline circuit]], observed wide-ranging inputs to both PL>NAc and PL>RMTg populations, including cortical, thalamic, and limbic areas. Both primarily had inputs from ipsilateral [[prelimbic]] and [[infralimbic]] cortex. Comparing the two populations, PL>NAc had more input from broad cortical and subcortical areas, including contralateral PL, while PL>RMTg had greater ipsilateral PL and IL input.

# Open questions
The largest difference was in PL and IL inputs, both ipsi and contralateral. But this is a sort of a circular logic. PL can't just keep passing information between hemispheres -- there needs to be unique input and output. What is the funciton of the extensive reciprocal connections? Does it serve to amplify smaller differences?
