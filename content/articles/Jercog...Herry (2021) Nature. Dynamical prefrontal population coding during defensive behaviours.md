The [[PFC]] (specifically [[prelimbic]]) encodes threat representation and initiates avoidance.

# Abstract
Using shuttle box avoidance, recorded [[PFC]] (basically [[prelimbic]]) activity during task. Found units were heterogenously modulated during task while aligning to tone onset. Found different results when aligning to onset of behavior (avoidance). Looking at Principal Component Space, significant differences in trajectories of different kinds of trials. 
Inhibited amygdala via muscimol infusion and saw reduced [[PFC]] CS+ / CS- decoder accuracy during times when tone was offline (intermittent, repeated tone). 
~25% of cells modulated in 2s prior to movement initiation, most of which did not also encode tone responsiveness. 
Inhibiting [[PFC]] starting just prior to tone onset increased latency to avoid while inhibition after tone onset decreased avoidance probability. 

# Key points
- Had really cool plots showing population trajectories for different trial types projected onto first three principal components (latent dimensions). This is something I want to do.
- Did a good job controlling for motor confounds in encoding.
- Inhibition of [[amygdala]] (specifically [[basolateral amygdala]]) decreased avoidance, and decreased PFC CS+ / CS- decoder accuracy when no sound was online. This indicates that auditory information reaches the PFC in a way that helps the PFC discriminate the cues. But this representation is not maintained when the sound is not immediately present. 
- Adds evidence that among [[prelimbic]] neurons, some are excited and some are inhibited by conditioned tone onset.
