# Summary
[[PFC]] is known to control movement. One model of movement control divides the [[PFC]] into 'reactive' and 'proactive' stopping of movement. Reactive stopping is when stopping is required due to external cue; proactive stopping is when stopping occurs due to internal goal. Exactly how the parts of the PFC participate in this is unknown.

Task:  lever press initiates a tone. Animal is required to hold lever down for duration of tone (pseudorandom, 0.3 - 1s). If animal releases in 0.5s after tone ends, animal is rewarded. 
Animals can perform correctly, release early, release late, with either a short tone or a long tone.

Bilateral opto inhibition during tone period. 

Short tone should mainly rely on reactive behavior, while long tone should rely more on proactive behavior and response inhibition. 
Bilateral inhibition of different PFC areas had different effects on task behavior.  {{There is a dorsoventral gradient of motor control in PFC.}}

Inhibiting [[prelimbic]] caused large increase in premature responses, specifically on long-tone delay condition. 
Contrast to inhibiting [[infralimbic]] , which caused large decrease in premature responses, specifically on long-tone delay condition.

# Key points
* Only about 10% of cells in PL or IL were task modulated on any given part of trial, but altogether ~60% of cells were task modulated
* Changes in error rates between PL and IL were clear, but otherwise differences were less clear between the two. More clear between PL and VO.


# Open questions
* Is the concept of reactive and proactive motor control applicable to fear memory and instinctual freezing?
