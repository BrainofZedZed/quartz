# 1 Line
Activity from auditory thalamus to [[basolateral amygdala]] immediately after auditory cued fear conditioning is required for both recent (1d) and remote (21d) memory, whereas immediate activity from [[temporal association cortex]] to [[basolateral amygdala]] is only required for remote memory. 

# Abstract
Did one trial auditory cued fear conditioning (pure tone), with 2s 0.5mA shock. Animals remained in chamber after shock for 30s. Then moved to neutral context at different timepoints (2min, 3h, 1 day) and recieved 15min of light. For retrieval, did new context, with 3min tone delivery. Freezing during first minute quantified. Recent method tested at 1d; remote at 20d. 

# Key points
FIG 1 Inhibition of both MGm>LA and AuV/TeA>LA fibers immediately (2min) after learning impairs auditory cued fear conditioning recent (1d) recall but not contextual recall. 

FIG 2 Control experiment for post-inhibition rebound. Brief stimulation of same fibers 17min after learning had no effect on recall, suggesting rebound firing was not driving the effect in Fig 1. 

FIG 3 Inhibiting MGm>LA and TeA>LA immediately after learning does not disrupt very recent (1h) memory. Inhibiting fibers 3h after learning does not disrupt 1d memory. Inhibiting fibers 1d after learning does not disrupt 1d memory. 

FIG 4 Immediate post learning inhibition of MGm>LA by itself impairs 1d recall. Ineffective if inhibition is not immediately after learning. Recall is still impaired at 21d Immediate post learning. inhibition of TeA>LA by itself does not impair 1d recall. 

FIG 5 Immediate post learning inhibition of TeA>LA by itself impairs 21d recall. Inhibition immediately prior to 21d recall has no effect.

# Comments
What is the mechanism driving consolidation of TeA>LA for remote memory? Is it that recent TeA>LA activity -- consolidation immediately after learning -- lays the synaptic groundwork such that when [[temporal association cortex]] is brought into the fear circuit, the [[basolateral amygdala]] projections are already potentiated? Or is there some feedback between BLA and TeA that strengths over time?

How does this tie in with [[Sacco and Sacchetti (2010) Science. Role of secondary sensory cortices in emotional memory retrieval in rats]]. When did they lesion TeA?
