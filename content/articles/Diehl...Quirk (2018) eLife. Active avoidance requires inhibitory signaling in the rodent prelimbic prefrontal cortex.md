# Summary
[[prelimbic]] neurons are well characterized in their role for fear conditioning, but their role in active avoidance is less well-known. It's been previously shown that inactivating [[prelimbic]] neurons impairs avoidance but not freezing, and that [[prelimbic]] [[cFos]] expression correlates with avoidance

Methods: rats (only male), cannula and muscimol, unit recordings in PL, trained to lever press for food, and platform-mediated avoidance:  trained on a tone that co-terminates with a shock. Variable inter-trial interval. Tone is 30 seconds. Did 9 trials per day for 10 days.

# Key points
Infusion of muscimol into [[prelimbic]] delayed avoidance behavior following cue onset, but also increased freezing (mildly)

Optogenetic silencing of rostral [[prelimbic]] neurons does NOT delay avoidance; instead, mildly increases the delay to avoidance behavior. No strong effect in caudal section.

Single unit recordings reveal that rats trained on avoidance had many (33%) rostral [[prelimbic]] neurons that were inhibited at tone onset, whereas naive rats or rats trained only on fear conditioning with no avoidance did not show any inhibited units (no inhibited units in caudal)

* In contrast, no increase in inhibition occurred when animals entered the avoidance platform

Opto activation of rostral (but not caudal) [[prelimbic]] to approximate basal levels during tone presentation delayed or abolished avoidance behavior

Overall, argues that reduction in [[prelimbic]] firing, in a subclass of neurons, acts to signal the possibility for avoidance of the shock, not a signal of fear conditioning per se

# Open questions

Why is there a difference between muscimol and ArchT inactivation of [[prelimbic]]?

In what ways are rostral and caudal [[prelimbic]] different?

Why were behavioral baselines so different for similar, even control, groups?
