# Summary
The PVT is an important node that is recruited into the cortico-amydalar fear network for retrieval, leading to a PL --> PVT --> CeA fear recollection at recent remote (1d, 8d) timepoints.

![[While fear behavior appears constant with time, the circuits mediating the behavior are not.]]

# Key points
* Muscimol delivery to [[paraventricular]] nucleus 1d, 7d, or 28d (but not 6h) after fear conditioning impaired freezing (tested 30min after delivery). Critically, freezing also impaired 24hr after delivery, after muscimol is offline.

* However, inactivation of PVT ''without'' reexposure to cue had no effect on next day performance. Additionally, protein synthesis inhibitor anisomyosin had no effect. ''These additional data suggest that PVT are crucial for retrieval and updating cue-outcome associations, but not necessarily for consolidation.''

* PVT cFos expression follows same timecourse, as does single unit responses.

* note:  using HR3.0, PL terminal inhibition in PVT resulted in 13/47 decreasing firing, 9/47 cells increasing firing
* Inhibiting PVT projections to CeA [[basolateral amygdala]] at late but not early timepoints impairs retrieval.
