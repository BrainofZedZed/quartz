# Summary
PFC ([[prelimbic]]) is involved in Pavlovian conditioning and contains heterogenous populations of local, inhibitory, and projection neurons. How different populations participate in Pavlovian conditioning is unknown.

![[PFC and PL population encoding is diverse; specific projections populations are more distinct]]

[[prelimbic]]-[[nucleus accumbens]] neurons encode learned CS+ cues. PL-NA activity grows more selective as learning occurs, enhancing CS+ repsonse and diminishing CS- response.
PFC-PVT ([[paraventricular]] nucleus of the thalamus) neurons gain inhibitory inputs to silence them during CS+.

Opto manipulation of PFC-NA neurons control expression of previously acquired reward seeking, but not learning.
Opto manipulatin of PFC-PVT neurons control both learning and expression of reward seeking.

# Key points
* When looking at projection populations, Fig 1 is to compare the anatomical overlap between them. Can use CTB with different fluorophores.

* Recording response from all neurons in PFC will show lots of mixed responses. Need to parse them out to find something more particular.

# Open questions
* How does the function of PL-PVT neurons in this Pavlovian conditioning paradigm align with PL-PVT neurons in remote memory fear conditioning paradigm?
	* Perhaps different subclasses? PL-PVT projects to CeA for fear conditioning. Wonder if CeA is similarly involved here.
