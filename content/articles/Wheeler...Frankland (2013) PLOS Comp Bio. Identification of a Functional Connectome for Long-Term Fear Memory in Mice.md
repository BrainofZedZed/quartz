Remote contextual fear memory engages a cortico-thalamo-hippocampal circuit moreso than recent memory.

# Abstract


# Key points
Describes both recent and remote networks as having 'small-world topology'. 

Remote memory was associated iwth increased inter-cortical functional connections, particularly  [[PFC]] and [[prelimbic]], [[thalamus]], ahd [[hippocampus]].

At remote timepoint, prefrontal inter-connectedness increased, suggesting more engagement of PFC. Also at remote timepoint, hippocampal cfos activity was reduced compared to early, but remained tightly coupled with thalamic and cortical activity. 

Suggests that hippocampal activity plays a sustained role in remote fear memory.
