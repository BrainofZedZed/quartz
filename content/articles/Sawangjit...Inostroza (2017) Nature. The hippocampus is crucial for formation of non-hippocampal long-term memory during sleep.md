Hippocampal spindles during slow-wave sleep promote remote memory for a non-hippocampal-dependent task (novel object recognition). 

# Abstract
Sleep promotes consolidation of memory, but does it promote consolidation of non-hippocampal dependent memory? Trained rats on object-location or object-recognition tasks allowing sleep or no-sleep in the 2 hour period following, and testing memory immediately or remotely (1 or 3 wk). Object-recognition memory improved at remote, but not recent, timepoints with sleep after encoding. Intrahippocampal muscimol during post-encoding sleep abolished sleep-induced remote memory benefits. Supports the idea that hippocampus is involved in consolidating traditionally 'non-hippocampal-dependent' memory.

# Key points
FIG 1 With post-encoding sleep, animals retained NOR memory at 3 weeks, while no-sleep animals had impaired NOR memory. (note: small n, high variability, 2/8 subjects showed neophobia). Post-encoding sleep was required for both recent (2h) and semi-remote (1 week) NOL performance. 

FIG 2 intrahippocampal muscimol during post-encoding sleep abolishes sleep-induced benefits on NOR remote memory. Intrahippocampal muscimol during remote retrieval has no effect. Weirdly -- intrahippocampal during post-encoding WAKEFULNESS tended to ENHANCE 1 week NOR memory. 

FIG 3 Slow wave sleep spindles during the post-encoding (2hour) positively correlate with remote NOR memory performance. Effects during the first 30min are even stronger.

# Comments
Authors argue that hippocampus plays a role in consolidating the contextual information involved in a non-hippocampal-dependent memory, because all memories take place within time and space. 

Does it just provide contextual informaiton? Or is there a more fundamental aspect of the slow wave activity that reconsolidates the entire experience?

Data from [[Sugden...Andermann (2020) Nature Neuroscience. Cortical reactivations of recent sensory experiences predict bidirectional network changes during learning]] would argue that hippocampal ripples drive cortical re-activation during quiet waking soon after learning -- in a visual go/no-go task which is not likely to have a strong contextual component (or at the very least is not mediated by hpipocampus)

Supports the idea that [[the hippocampus is involved in cued fear conditioning]] indirectly -- shows that hippocampus is important for non-spatial memories.
