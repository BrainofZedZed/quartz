# Summary
Establishes "higher-order" thalamus that is capable of thalamic, top-down control.

While bottom-up sensory encoding is well understood in cortex, top-down memory encoding is less well understood.

Neocortical L1 receives wide-spread input, likely including from top-down modulation. Contributions of higher-order thalamus are not well understood.
"Higher-order" thalamus is simply a well-connected thalamus, receiving input from diverse sources.

Recent literature has shown rapid learning-induced plasticity in other higher order thalamic nuclei (posterior medial), strengthening their projections to sensory cortex (S1) following whisker-association training.
This paper asked if a higher-order thalamic nucleus that projects to higher level auditory areas is involved in auditory learning.  It is, and is required.

# Key points
Higher-order medial geniculate receives widespread input, projects to higher order auditory cortex (especially [[temporal association cortex]]). 

2P imaging of HO-MG boutons in AuV show learning-dependent changes.

Inactivating AuV-projecting HO-MG cells impairs auditory fear conditioning 24hr recall (but not conditioning).

HO-MG axons are modulated by GABA(B), likely released by neurogliaform cells in AuV layer 1.
