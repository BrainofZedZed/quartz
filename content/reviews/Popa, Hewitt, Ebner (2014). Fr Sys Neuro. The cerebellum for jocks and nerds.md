# Summary
If the [[universal cerebellar transform]] is real, that means we can apply knowledge of cerebellar motor computations to cognitive domains

[[Purkinje cells]] in different parts of the cerebellum encode kinematics of different motor behaviors

Individual [[Purkinje cells]] encode both prediction of consequences of motor commands as well as respond to sensory feedback

Therefore, modulation of one area of the cerebellum can have cascading effects on the internal model, by disrupting just a piece of the internal model

Complex spikes are traditionally thought of as error signals, but that's an incomplete understanding. Simple spike firing (in random tracking task) correlates with error parameters too (across multiple error dimensions)

Dual error signal representation is best understood through a lens of the internal model. The internal model requires both prediction of consequences and sensory feedback to compute error

Dual encoding, with different representations at different timepoints relative to an action, is likely a general property of [[Purkinje cells]], and likely applies to cognitive as well as motor domains

Evidence for internal model information being used across multiple domains comes from a visual hand tracking study in monkeys, in which the researchers observed that same information being used in a discrimination task (Stanley and Miall, 2009)

Because simple spikes encode both motor prediction and sensory feedback (error), they could provide the performance signals required of cognitive forward models, circumventing the need for complex spikes to represent error (as there are sparse connections between cerebral cortex and inferior olive)

Ties in to Wager...Luo (2019) paper showing granule cells encoding reward. Their parallel fibers must encode reward as well, and therefore likely simple spike firing is modulated by reward
