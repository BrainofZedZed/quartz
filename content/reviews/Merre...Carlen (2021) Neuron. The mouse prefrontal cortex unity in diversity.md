# Abstract
Prefrontal regions are best defined by connectivity, with individual regions participating in larger sub-territories that share a high degree of similar connectivity and likely similar functions. Proposes three subdivisions based on :  dmPFC, vmPFC (including [[prelimbic]] and [[infralimbic]]), and vlPFC.


# Key points
The defining feature of the [[PFC]] is the ability to structure the present to serve the future (Fuster, 2015, textbook).

Function of the [[PFC]] is theorized to represent and produce sequences of actions.

Prefrontal intrinsic connectivity is very extensive, with additional wide ranging afferents and efferents. Suggests that various PFC regions are interdependent, sharing behavioral and computational functions.

![[What is the prefrontal cortex#canonical definition]]

[[PFC]] has highest levels of recriprocal connectivity among all cortical areas, arguing it is at the top of the cortical heirarchy.

In situ hybridization data of the mouse [[PFC]] reveals that 82% are excititatory (NRN1 expresing), 17% are inhibitory (GAD67 expressing), and 1% are neuromodulatory (Ero et al 2018).

There are more [[PV]] and [[SST]] cells in PFC regions compared to other  cortical regions, suggesting more complex information processing (Kim et al 2017, Cell).

Combining studies looking at corticocortical, corticothalamic, thalamocortical, and whole-brain mapping, authors propose three subdivisions of PFC:  dmPFC, vmPFC, and vlPFC. These groupings are based on high degrees of overlapping connectivity within groups, and low amounts between groups. 

Has good collection of papers showing why lesions studies suck.

vmPFC experiments involve time, rule switching, and context representation, in alignment with its connectivity to limbic areas which likely have a role in assessing internally generated information.

Baesd on the [[mixed-selectivity framework of PFC encoding]], it's important to consider task variables, behavior states, and the intersection thereof, when deciphering function. 

For "vast majority" of cortical neurons, spontaneous movement is best predictor of activity. Additionally, movement-state (eg running, whisking, immobility) strongly affect activity.

[[prelimbic]] activity has been observed to tile for the duration of working memory tasks.

# Comments
If [[prelimbic]] activity tiles the delay period in a task -- could we maybe see something like that during a tone (after learning), with distributed activity through the duration of the tone?
