# Abstract
>It is becoming increasingly apparent that long-term memory formation relies on a distributed network of brain areas. While the hippocampus has been at the center of attention for decades, it is now clear that other regions, in particular the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are taking an active part as well. Recent evidence suggests that the mPFC—traditionally implicated in the long-term storage of memories—is already critical for the early phases of memory formation such as encoding. In this review, we summarize these findings, relate them to the functional importance of the mPFC connectivity, and discuss the role of the mPFC during memory consolidation with respect to the different theories of memory storage. Owing to its high functional connectivity to other brain areas subserving memory formation and storage, the mPFC emerges as a central hub across the lifetime of a memory, although much still remains to be discovered.

# Key points
- mPFC in Early Memory Phases
- mPFC Engram
- Post-Learning molecular modifications in mPFC
- mPFC functional connectivity
	- inhibiting input to mPFC ([[basolateral amygdala]] > [[prelimbic]], [[entorhinal cortex]] > [[prelimbic]], [[hippocampus]] > [[anterior cingulate]]) during encoding impairs remote memory but has no effect on recent memory, for contextual fear conditioning
		- differs from [[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience. Temporal evolution of cortical ensembles promoting remote memory retrieval]] in which [[prelimbic]] is inhibited during learning for no effect on recent or remote. Probably a difference between contextual and cued.
- Models of memory formation
	- [[Failures in systems consolidation theory]]
		- Involvement of [[PFC]] in encoding and recent fear memory, alongside involvement of [[hippocampus]] in remote memory, suggest there are parallel memory traces.
