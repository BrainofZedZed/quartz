# Key points
Traditional defintiions of Pavlovian conditioning are that over time, CS takes on US response. 

Pavlov comes from old physiology tradition with a low level mechanical reflex framework of the body. Modern thinking is more steeped in the associative tradition, originating in philosophy. It views conditioning as learning the relations among events in the evironment, which is used to represent the structure of the world. Within that associative framework, Pavlovian conditioning is a vast domain with rich representations of the world and links between those representations and behavior. 

There are three parts of Pavlovian condititioning (all called Pavlovian conditioning): the circumstances producing learning (the experimental procedure of CS and US), the content of the learning (the act itself of making these associations), and then the effects of the learning on behavior. 

### Circumstances producing Pavlovian conditioning 
Traditional 'US-CS' conditioning requires pairing or contiguity of the US and CS. The associative view does not require contiguity. It emphasizes how much information one stimulus gives about another. This means that learning is largely based on the base rate of the US. If it occurs frequently, both out but always during the CS, there is little learning. But if it occurs infrequently, but always during the CS, there is a lot of learning. 

### Content of Pavlovian Conditioning: what is learned 
Learning is not restricted to relation between CS evoking US. Associations are formd among complex representations, which are themselves linked in relationships to other representations (transitive property of association). For example, each during CS-US learning, both are also associated with context in which they occurred (Balsam and Tomie, 1985). The web of relational learning allows for complex, content-rich representations of the world. 

### Influences on behavior 
The CS does not simply evoke the behavior of the US. For example, shock evokes movement; tone associated with shock evokes freezing. Additionally, the nature of the CS can affect behavior. Pavlovian conditioning is not a shifting of behavioral response from US to CS, but generates behavior that is informed by information given by the presence of the CS and its associations.

>Descriptions of conditioning, such as those just cited, come from a long and honorable tradition in physiology, the reflex tradition in which Pavlov worked and within which many early behaviorists thought. This tradition sees conditioning as a kind of low-level mechanical process in which the control over a response is passed from one stimulus to another. Much modern thinking about conditioning instead derives largely from the associative tradition originating in philosophy. It sees conditioning as the learning that results from exposure to relations among events in the environment. Such learning is a primary means by which the organism represents the structure of its world. Consequently, Pavlovian conditioning must have considerable richness, both in the relations it represents and in the ways its representation influences behavior, a richness that was not envisioned within the reflex tradition.

>Pavlovian conditioning is not a stupid process by which the organism willy-nilly forms associations between any two stimuli that happen to co-occur. Rather, the organism is better seen as an information seeker using logical and perceptual relations among events, along with its own preconceptions, to form a sophisticated representation of its world.
