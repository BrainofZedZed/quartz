Great review of circuitry of recent and remote auditory cued fear memory

# Abstract


# Key points
Defines 'early' retrieval as hours after learning, late as days and weeks.

Defines early consolidation as a few hours, 'synaptic consolidation', and late consolidation as 'systems consolidation'. But isn't systems consolidation also mediated by changes in synaptic strength? 

Important distinction: a circuit being necessary for memory retrieval is not the same as that circuit being the specific site for memory storage.
Another important distinction: at a behavioral level, fear memory retrieval and fear expression are similar (freezing), but are different circuits. To disentangle requires showing the manipulation impairs retrieval but not expression (eg recall cue presentation vs fox urine presentation or something).

### Early retrieval of fear memories
Acquisition of auditory fear memory requires integration of snesory information in amygdala. Information about tone and shock from cortical and thalamic areas converage on lateral amygdala neurons, causing synaptic changes that sotre tone-shock associations. Similar changes occur in central amygdala.

#### [[Amygdala]] microcircuits for early retrieval
[[basolateral amygdala]] is necessary for retrieval of fear memory 24 hr following conditioning. BLA projects to central amygdala, which projects to [[hypothalamus]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] which mediates autonomic fear functions and behavioral correlates.Central lateral amygdala neurons seem to inhibit central medial amygdalar neurons during fear memory.

#### Early retrieval requires [[prelimbic]]
Many [[prelimbic]] neurons show sustained tone-evoked firing 24 h after cued-fear conditioning. These responses depend on [[basolateral amygdala]]input to [[prelimbic]] (Sotres-Bayon 2012 Neuron; Senn 2014 Neuron). [[prelimbic]] projects to [[basolateral amygdala]] also facilitate fear retrieval [[Do-Monte...Quirk (2015) Nature. A temporal shift in the circuits mediating fear memory]]. Early (24 hr) retrieval also shows a increased 4 Hz coherence between [[prelimbic]] and [[basolateral amygdala]]. Artificially driving PL-BLA circuit at 4 Hz induces freezing in naive mice (Karalis 2016 Nat Neuro).

### Late retrieval of fear memories
Primary auditory cortex neurons show increased tone-evoked firing 1-4 hr after tone fear learning (Quirk...LeDoux 1997 Neuron). [[auditory cortex]] latency (~30ms) is longer than [[basolateral amygdala]] amygdala latency (~15ms), suggesting [[basolateral amygdala]] resposne is independent of primary [[auditory cortex]] [[Romanski and LeDoux (1992). Journal of Neuroscience. Equipotentiality of Thalamo-Amygdala and Thalamo-CorticoAmygdala Circuits in Auditory Fear Conditioning]] . Primary [[auditory cortex]] is critical for complex tones and trace fear conditioning though [[Letzkus...Luthi (2011) - Nature - A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex]]

[[temporal association cortex]] is critical for remote fear memory recall [[Sacco and Sacchetti (2010) Science. Role of secondary sensory cortices in emotional memory retrieval in rats]] and for ongoing consolidation of remote (30 day) but not mid-recent (7 day) memory [[Grosso...Sacchetti (2015) Nat Com. The higher order auditory cortex is involved in the assignment of affective value to sensory stimuli]]

Evolving role of [[temporal association cortex]] in auditory fear conditioning parallels [[anterior cingulate]] in contextual fear conditioning.  [[anterior cingulate]] is required at 30 days but not 1 day, opposite the hippocampus (Frankland 2004 Science).  Retrieval of fear memories is associated with [[anterior cingulate]] spine growth, and blocking [[anterior cingulate]] spine growth in the first week after learning disrupts consolidation and remote retrieval (Vetere 2011 PNAS).

There is mixed evidence for the role of [[basolateral amygdala]] in late fear memory retrieval. Lots of early lesion studies in rodents suggest its necessary. Monkey studies do not. And more recent opto studies show silencing [[basolateral amygdala]] output at even semi-recent timepoint (3d, 6d) does not disrupt freezing. Overall suggests [[basolateral amygdala]] is required for early (1 day) but not older fear memory retrieval.

What is the timepoint for recruitment of PVT? What is the timepoint for recuitment of PL?

Has anyone directly shown that 'systems consolidation' requires changes in synaptic strength? Are these changes similar to early consolidation period? 

If pure tone and complex tone utilize different cortical circuitry, isn't the use of complex tone more ecologically valid in all circumstances? Why even study pure tone? 

Does TeA show increased spine denisty after consolidation (assume yes). Would blocking PL>TeA activity chronically with DREADDs be sufficient to block that?
