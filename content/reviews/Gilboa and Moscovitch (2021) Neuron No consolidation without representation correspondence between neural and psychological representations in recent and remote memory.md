Memory is retained in multiple forms with each form having a distinct physiological substrate, such that there is a neural-psychological representation correspondence (NPRC), which allows for multi-directional, dynamic interaction between different memory representations. 

# Abstract
In contrast to the [[systems consolidation]] theory of memory, the authors propose that memory exists in different states with distinct underlying neurobiology (NPRC). The particularities of the encoding event determine the relative strength and dominance of each memory during learning. Over time, the different memory representations interact and change their relative strength. That, combined with different retrieval demands, determines the likelihood of a specific form of memory getting expressed.

A change in neural systems underlying a memory changes the phenomenological experience of the memory itself -- changes in consolidation (neural representation) lead to changes in psychological and experiential representation
