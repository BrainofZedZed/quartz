> Multiple trace theory incorporates the Indexing Theory (IT) to a broader model, which also extends into remote memory consolidation. The MTT postulates that the hippocampal formation is the first to encode the initial information upon learning, in a sparse and distributed manner, and that, similarly as in the IT, this hippocampal ensemble acts as an index to link the cortical neurons that are also representing the incoming information. Both neuronal ensembles, cortical and hippocampal, form the full memory trace, or engram as we would call it nowadays. The hippocampus provides the contextual information to link the individual pieces of information stored in the cortex from the start. However, in contrast to the IT, a new hippocampal trace will be created at each recall, indexing the same, or part of the same, cortical information, resulting in the creation of parallel and multiple traces distributed in the brain, making them harder to disrupt or erase.
