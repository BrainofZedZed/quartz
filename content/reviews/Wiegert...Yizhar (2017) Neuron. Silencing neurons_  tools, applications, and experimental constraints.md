# Summary
Great review on the state of the art of inhibition. Primarily focuses on opsins but also good coverage of DREADDs, as well as optoGPCRs.

# Key points
* Some inhibitiory opsins show a decline in photocurrent amplitude over prolonged periods.
	* Early (circa 2011) inhibitory opsins showed substantial reductions:  50-90% over a 60 second period.

* GABA reversal potential can be significantly changed within 1 second of chloride pump activation. 
* Increased firing upon light-off can occur, but is mitigated by a ramp-like termination

* Terminal inhibition faces unique challenges:
	* axonal trafficking of opsins takes a long time
	* can require higher light power than somatic inhibition
	* axonal cytosol can have a different makeup than somatic cytosol, making effects sometimes unpredictable
	* validation is difficult
* optoGPCRs that silence P/Q calcium channels, which are require for presynaptic neurotranssmitter vesicle fusion, are promising future avenues but haven't been well developed
* Current best tools for optogenetic terminal inhibition are chloride pumps.
