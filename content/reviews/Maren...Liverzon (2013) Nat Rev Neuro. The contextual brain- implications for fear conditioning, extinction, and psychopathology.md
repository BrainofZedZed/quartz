# Summary
What is a context?
Broad view:  a set of circumstances surrounding an event. The internal (cognitive and hormonal) and external (environmental and social) backdrop against which psychological processes operate. Differs from cues that are arranged as signals for other events. Contexts are multisensory, diffuse, and continuously present. Contexts are spatial, but also:  temporal, interoceptive (hormonal and physiological states, eg stress or hunger), cognitive (context for how information is encoded, eg stimulus association), and sociocultual.

For context learning to occur, animals must form a representation of the context first, then can associate it with a US. Contexts are made up of their discrete elements but are quickly learned as a getalt. Multiple memories, each with different variations of a context, can be associated with the same context.

[[hippocampus]] plays a crucial role in defining the spatial component of a context. Lesioning hippocampus creates deficit in forming and storing a contextual representation, NOT a deficit in context-US association.

# Open questions
* is the boundary between contexts a binary event? Or is it a spectrum? 
	* It seems binary -- you either are or are not "in" a specific context. Each context likely has a range of manifestations, but once a boundary has been crossed, it is a different context.
