# 1 Line
[[PFC]] has segregated roles for fear memory -- [[anterior cingulate]] mediates formation of aversive memory, [[prelimbic]] mediates fear expression, while [[infralimbic]] mediates fear extinction.

# Key points
Pretraining [[anterior cingulate]] inactivation prevented cued fear acquisition

post-training (at what time point) inactivation of AC impaired remote but not recent recall of contextual fear 

[[prelimbic]] inactivation, both pre- and post-training, reduced fear expression without altering extinction

whereas inactivation of IL had no effect on fear expression but impaired fear extinction

PL likely promotes fear expression through projections to central amygdala

Theta synchrony increases between PFC and BLA during REM, with BLA leading

Increased synchrony between HPC, BLA, PFC correlate with fear

Caveat with studies of LFP: while global population may act one way, subpopulations (eg projection populations) may act another

* [[PFC and PL population encoding is diverse; specific projections populations are more distinct]]

mPFC behaves more inconsistently in contextual fear settings, suggesting the mPFC neurons have context-specific tuning parameters

* supports the [[mixed-selectivity framework of PFC encoding]]

PL single units increase activity (ie encode) aversive conditioned stimuli, while IL single units encode conditioned stimuli post-extinction

# Summary
Has good summary of [[Prelimbic and infralimbic afferents]]
