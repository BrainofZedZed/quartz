title: Connor & Knierim (2017) Nature Neuroscience.  Integration of objects and space in perception and memory
year: 2017

# Summary
Review article (but strangely published in regular Nature Neuroscience) on spatial and object perception, integration, and memory. Most helpful were the descriptions of [[entorhinal cortex]] and distinctions between medial and lateral aspects.  Overall, suggests that the dichotomy of dorsal visual stream leading to "where", following parahippocampal - MEC paths, and the ventral visual stream leading to "what", following perirhinal - LEC paths, are not so binary and are more blurred. Overall, these paths, containing both types of navigation-related information (though to differing degrees), converge in the hippocampus, with PHC- MEC carrying mostly spatial information, while the PRC - LEC carries mostly context and object information.

# Key points
*Objects do not exist in a vacuum. They always exist within an environment, and object-location associations are inevitable.
*LEC lesions can cause object-location memory deficits
*LEC neurons are known to be object-sensitive, and evidence exists for responsiveness to objects per se, as well as object-location associations
**object-trace cells in the LEC respond to previous locations of object-location pairings, and can persist for a long time (17 days)
*object-vector cells, encoding space that is a consistent vector between the animal and an object, demonstrate that hippocampus is sensitive to objects
*hierarchies of signaling exist in entorhinal cortex (Keene, 2016, JNeuro)
**LEC neurons are strongly responsive to contexts and objects, weakly responsive to space
**MEC neurons are strongly responsive to space, weakly responsive to objects
