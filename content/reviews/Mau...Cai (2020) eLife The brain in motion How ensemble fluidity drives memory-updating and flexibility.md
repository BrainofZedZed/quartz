Memory is not a static recording of previous events but instead more of a continually updated model of the world.

# Abstract


# Key points
Argues that 'representational #drift', or changes to neural activity despite unchanging internal or external state, provides a constant low level of noise that continuously readies new connections to the ensemble. Drfit is seen across types of memories and across different regions, suggesting that drift is a ubiquitous feature of memory systems. 
 
Synaptic turnover happens constantly across a substantial portion of cells -- even in the absence of action potentials. This could be one mechanism by which drift happens. Persistent spines are more consistent in the cortex than in hippocampus (Attardo 2015) Spine turnover rate positively correlates with ability to learn new task (Frank 2018) and is required for learning. 
 
 Memory retrieval re-activates the neural state space of that memory, which can be described as limiting the possible neural state space available for encoding a new encoding. Events occurring with close temporal proximity can modify each other. "Memory allocation hypothesis": the excitability of a neuron predisposes it for encoding a memory. Because the excitability and connectivity of all neurons is constantly changing, there are constantly shifting possibilities for new neurons to join the memory network. 
 
 Synaptic potentiation is saturated in engram neurons (Choi et al 2018), suggesting that as neurons exit the ensemble, they are depotentiated. This could be due to suppression from other neurons competing to be in the ensemble -- eg, ensembles formed during extinction learning inhibit ensembles formed during fear learning (Lacagnina 2019). Re-activating ensembles alongside new neurons that represent new information can link the two, incorporating elements of new and old firing patterns into a new ensemble. This modified ensemble then represents the updated memory. 
 
 New memories are not created arbitrarily but instead are contrained by the existing functional connections between neurons, which facilitate pre-existing patterns of activity. Both excitability and functional connectivity bias the composition and temporal coordination of recruited neurons during memory-updating. But to actually induce physical changes in the synaptic strengths of these ensembles, the brain must modify synapses using plasticity proteins in concert with temporally coincident neural activity. 
 
 For neurons to form a network, they need to spike in a temporally coordinated fashion at the millisecond scale -- [[spike timing dependent plasticity]] (Bi and Poo, 1998)
