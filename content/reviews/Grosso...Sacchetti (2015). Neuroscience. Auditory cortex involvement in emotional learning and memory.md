# 1 Line
The auditory cortex has an on-going and dynamic role in emotional learning and retrieval.

# Key points
the auditory cortex participates in emotional learning by processing the sensory features of auditory stimuli paired with emotional consequences and by transmitting this information to the amygdala.

following emotional experiences, the auditory cortex undergoes learning induced changes that are highly speciﬁc, associative and long lasting.

starting from the early phase of memory encoding, the auditory cortex has a more prominent role in emotional learning, through its connections with subcortical nuclei, than is typically acknowledged

# Summary
standard emotional memory hypothesis: sensory info from cortex (thalamo-cortico-amygdala) and thalamus (thalamo-amygdala) reaches amygdala, and either/both are used in associative learning

However, thalamo-cortico-amygdala route is required for fear memory retention, whereas thalamo-amygdala isn't required but is necessary for full expression (Boatman and Kim, 2006)

Early lesion studies may suffer from confounds due to comepnsatory mechanisms, or redundant pathways. Lesioning sensory cortex and not seeing a deficit on sensory perception and discrimination may likely be an effect of re-organization

Early sensory cortex is involved in the emotional learning of certain stimuli, perhaps depending on their complexity as evidenced by plasticity related changes (Aizenberg and Geffen, 2013); [[Dalmay...Letzkus (2019) Neuron. A critical role for neocortical processing of threat memory]]. 

some auditory cortex interneurons are responsive to both aversive and appetitive USs, suggesting they signal aversive quality of the stimulus (Letzkus 2011; Pi 2013)

Altogether, these ﬁndings suggest that the activity of the auditory cortex is profoundly inﬂuenced by the emotional information that is assigned to sensory stimuli during aﬀective experiences.

Emotional learning related changes to firing rate were more prominent in Te2 than Te3 or primary auditory (Te1). 

* Would have assumed Te3 would be most prominent. Interesting.

Higher order sensory cortices participate in perception of sensory signals as well as shape, and are shaped, by the emotional response; they participate in linking sensory stimuli to their aﬀective meaning and in storing this information over time.

sensory cortex is likely engaged in both recent and remote memories. However, in both acquisition and recent memory, multiple circuits are engaged in this process, making cortex-mediated memory sufficient but not necessary. At remote timepoints, the memory is more exclusively mediated by cortical mechanisms, making it necessary

during acquisition of emotional learning, cortico-amygdalar information is bidirectional. Cortex sends information about the quality of the stimulus, and amygdala sends emotional information causing changes to cortical response properties

Auditory cortex projects to striatum and can bias behavior toward those associated with the encoded tones

[[Major sources of sensory input to the amygdala are higher order sensory cortices.]]
