!!1 Line
Animal models of PTSD should seek to align with both DSM and RDoC criteria, while accounting for individual variation in the response to the PTSD-inducing manipulation, similar to the variation seen in human resilience to PTSD.


!!Key points

Animal models of PTSD should factor in both the [[DSM-5 PTSD criteria]] and the [[RDoc domains]].

Important to study both the early and late effects of PTSD. Studying early effects shows the mechanisms involved in forming the maladaptive response, but many of the changes may be pro-resilience to combat the changes. Additionally, most PTSD treatment in humans occurs long after the traumatic event -- therefore studying what occurs at remote timepoints is more immediately translatable.

Using fear conditioning as a model of PTSD is based in the assumption that PTSD is rooted in an abnormal fear response. While there is variation, there seems to be less importance on the modality of PTSD-induction than the underlying activity it provokes.

It is important to use 'behavioral profiling' of individuals to determine responsiveness -- running a battery of tests to determine if an animal has PTSD-like symptoms or not, then analyzing differences based on their behavioral profile. Not all humans experiencing a traumatic event experience PTSD. Similarly, not all lab animals experiencing a PTSD-protocol exhibit PTSD
