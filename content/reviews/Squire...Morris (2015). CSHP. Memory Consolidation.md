# Summary
Great entry article into systems consolidation theory of memory.  Provides historical perspective going back into the 1880s, does a detailed overview of studies from amnesiac patients and identifying temporal gradients in memory deficits, goes into neuroimaging studies, then gets into animal studies, focusing on behavior, hippocampal lesions, and then moves onto studies of IEGs.

# Key points
Following a [[hippocampus]] lesion, remote memories are stronger than recent memories, which is a clear expression of the temporal gradient of memory consolidation

[[Systems consolidation]]:  the process by which the [[hippocampus]] guides the reorganization of the information stored in the neocortex such that it eventually becomes independent of the hippocampus

The "standard model of memory consolidation":  [[hippocampus]] binds disparate neocortical elements during learning, then guides a gradual consolidation process of that network until the network is independent of hippocampal activation 

Multiple regions are required for proper learning of a new memory (hippocampal, parahippocampa, entorhinal, perirhinal) but far fewer structures are required for recollection

One way to test the difference between semantic and autobiographical memory in humans is the "remember-know" distinction, whether someone "remembers" the event occurring, or simply "knows" that it occurred

Autobiographical memories utilize a particularly broad network for recollection, inclusive of but extending beyond the medial temporal lobe

Studies using [[CFC]] in rodents show temporal gradient of memory impairment following lesions

Appears that tasks with strong [[hippocampus]] demands, ie tasks with strong spatial navigation, are more difficult to observe temporal gradients of memory impairment following lesions

Other studies using water mazes did not show temporal gradients following lesions

Memory [[consolidation]] occurs more quickly if new information is similar to existing information, ie fits into a schema (Tse 2007)

This applies both to the task structure (ie learning the layout of a map, then adding onto it) but also to the experimental naivety of the animals

Experimentally naive animals have less general knowledge and information about the "world", ie any given task environment. Therefore it takes more time -- ie is more physiologically difficult -- to consolidate memory 

Metanovelty -- the novelty of novelty
- The finding that schemas and prior knowledge influence the incorporation of new knowledge emphasizes the need for habituation and training of animals prior to testing (or at least, controlling it)

Relates to concept of carryover effects, but far more broadly

In physiological terms, the structure of the engrams of similar memories are likely largely overlapping, whereas a highly novel memory would require linking many new connections, requiring more physiological work

[[Consolidation]] occurs via a hippocampal-neocortical dialogue

[[Consolidation]] of memory does not require new hippocampal-neocortical information, but it does require some communication, which may entail synaptogenesis or regulating plasticity.

"Tagging" of neocortical neurons occurs by [[hippocampus]] driven, local, posttranslational changes

Caution is to be exercised when interpreting IEG expression following memory retrieval. IEG expression may not reflect retrieval per se, but may also reflect the encoding of the new retrieval experience

[[Sleep]] is important for [[consolidation]] with two distinct processes in play:  replay, and downscaling

Replay, or reactivation of experiences, starts in the hippocampus and propogates outward, potentiating those synapses

Replay is initialized by oscillating neocortical up and down states (increased and decreased excitability). These oscillations spread to the medial temporal lobe, which initialize a [[sharp wave ripple]].

[[sharp wave ripple]] travels to the neocortex and causes a sleep spindle.

Downscaling, referring to the homeostatic processes that reduce synaptic strength, thought to be locally initiated and regulated

The combined actions of downscaling and replay create a push-pull effect, that increases the signal to noise ratio of the new memories
