# Abstract
'Our present hypothesis is that odor discrimination and recognition depend on self-organizing neural processes in the olfactory bulb. The process that we label the "expectation" of an odor is realized in theformationof strengthened connections in a network of neurons constituting the NCA. This assembly, whose role is to amplify and stereotype the small input received on any given inhalation, produces a disseminated but low-density activity pattern in response to the stimulus, and then provides the crucial mechanism for mediating the emergence of an odor-specific activity pattern in a process of bifurcation. With this state change the entire olfactory bulb, rather than the limited number of nerve cells comprising the NCA, is engaged by a process of global integration to produce a stereotypic activity pattern mediated by the NCA but going far beyond it. Thus, when placed in a learned input domain, the neural system has a tendency to generate a qualitatively distinctive form of ordered behavior that emerges from the chaotic background state.""

# Key points
### Methods 
olfactory conditioning using rabbits, CS+ led to water reward, CS- was unenforced. EEG implanted on olfactory bulb. Saw consistent odorant-specific differences across all channels of 64 electrode EEG, suggesting universal participation in odorant information. 

"All that distinguished one odorant EEG pattern from another was the spatial configuration of the average intensity over an event time window at the common frequency, in the manner that patterns of monochromatic light are distinguished from each other by shades of gray. Local variations in phase, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and other aspects of the 64 traces were not found to contain odorant-specific information." 

### Noise vs chaos
Difference between noise and chaos: a noisey system is stochastic (truly random). A chaotic system is deterministic -- ie given a start state, the outcome is predictable -- but the initial state of the system has a random component to it. Chaos is controlled noise with precisely defined properties "

Figure 11 indicates that the olfactory system and its corresponding model have a hierarchy of states. The basic neural dynamics and the equations are the same in all states but, depending on various neural conditions and model parameters, the systems behave differently (e.g., during waking, sleeping, bursts, interburst intervals, seizures, and so on). Both systems display the capacity for abrupt, dramatic, global jumps from one state to another. These are the bifurcations. These are analogous to phase transitions in physical systems: ice to water to steam, for example. The bifurcations occur in many forms and varieties, so a formal definition is difficult if not impossible to provide." 

### Roles of chaos in odor recognition
"We postulate that the selection of an attractor upon inhalation is made by the presence of a CS odorant in the inhaled air or by the absence of an odorant, leading to the selection of an attractor corresponding to the background odor, the behavioral status quo. That is, the chemical stimulation of a particular set of receptors places the mechanism into a particular basin when the attractors emerge under bifurcation. The system is released into its basal state with exhalation, setting the stage for the processing of a new sample of information about an odor in the inhaled air...We conjecture that chaotic activity provides a way of exercising neurons that is guaranteed not to lead to cyclic entrainment or to spatially structured activity" 

"In our view, then, chaos plays several crucial roles; the system is designed and built so as to ensure its own steady and controlled source of "noise" (i.e., chaos). Most remarkably, "signals" are not detected "in" the chaos because the mechanism turns the chaos "off' when it turns a signal "on."


### Learning and nerve cell assemblies
Nerve cell assemblies (NCAs) = ensembles
"During exhalation, when receptor input is low, the bulbar neurons tend to fall to a low level of activity and sensitivity. During inhalation the surge of receptor input not only excites bulbar neurons, it augments exponentially their tendency to fire in response to input from receptors and from each other. Their strength of interaction increases dramatically over the entire bulb. At some point a threshold is reached in which the entire bulbar mechanism bifurcates from a low-energy chaotic state to a high-energy state. The NCA operates at the moment of choice when the surge of receptor input strongly forces the bulb far away from its rest state to some new activity pattern."
- sensory input not only activates the relevant sensory receptors, but brings them to a state in which ensemble can more easily activate them as well, resulting in pattern completion and amplification of a learned signal pattern.
- Analogy to diastolic vs systolic modes (wrt heart beats)

### Roles of chaos
"We have suggested that without chaotic behavior the neural system cannot add a new odor to its repertoire of learned odors. Chaos provides the system with a deterministic "I don't know" state within which new activity patterns can be generated, as shown by what happens when the system encounters a previously unknown odor. If the odor occurs without reinforcement, habituation takes place; thereafter, the neural system exhibits patterned activity that we have identified as the control state for the status quo. With reinforcement, however, a completely different process occurs. If the odor is novel and the system does not already have a global activity pattern corresponding to the odor, then instead of producing one of its previously learned activity patterns, the system falls into a high-level chaotic state rather than into the basin for the background odor. This "chaotic well" enables the system to avoid all of its previously learned activity patterns and to produce a new one."

"In the neural system, chaos is the rule, and the patterned activity to which the system converges following each state change is never twice the same, so again the notion of pattern completion loses its meaning."

"We think that the notion of "destabilization" provides a better description of the essentials of neural functioning than the concept of pattern completion. In an alert, motivated animal, input destabilizes the system, leading to further destabilization and a bifurcation to a new form of patterned activity."
