# Summary
Review article focusing on remote memory in cued fear memory. Special emphasis is put on reorganization and expansion of memory ensemble, particularly in cortex. 

Raises important points about how the remote memory field is dominated by [[systems consolidation]] and its [[hippocampus]] bias. The alternative, [[multiple trace theory]], is widely thought inaccurate, but the article raises some points on how it may be more useful than previously thought.

# Key points
"Learning" is the generation of an internal representation as the result of an experience.

"Memory" is the retention of an internal representation over time.

"Retrieval" is accessing memories.

The two major models of memory  consolidation ([[systems consolidation]], [[multiple trace theory]]) are derived from hippocampal-dependent experience. No models account for time-dependent reorganization of amygdala-dependent cued fear memory retrieval.

Some lines of evidence contradict SCM. [[Acute inactivation of the hippocampus disrupts remote memory]], while longer inactivation does not.

The amygdala is a known long-term storage site for auditory cued fear memory. But little is known about its circuitry with remote memory.

In Pavlovian cued fear conditioning, CS and US converge on [[basolateral amygdala]]. This consolidates through Hebbian plasticity. BLA projects to [[central amygdala]], which has projections to brainstem and hypothalamus to control fear expression. 

Amygdala is required for acquisition and retrieval of both recent and remote cued fear memory. 

Sensory cortices are reciprocally connected with amygdala, carrying CS info to amygdala. Sensory cortices (associative; but papers doesn't note distinciton) are required for remote cued fear memory.

Data shows that sensory cortices are gradually incorporated into memory trace over time, while amygdala remains indispensable. Both SCM and MTT fit this.

PFC, and in particular [[prelimbic]], is associated with retrieval of (auditory) cued fear conditioning.

[[infralimbic]] cortex is associated with extinction, rather than acquisition, of fear memory.

ACC is associated with retrieval of spatial and contextual memory at remote time points.

[[paraventricular]] nucleus of the thalamus plays is a critical node in fear circuit. 
Inhibiting PL projections to PVT impaired later (7 day) but not early (6 hour) timepoint.
Inhibiting PL projections to BLA impaired retrieval at early (6h) but not later (7day) timepoint. 
Inhibiting PVT to central amygdala projections impaired late but not early retrieval.
''Suggests that PL -> BLA projections are critical for recent memory, but not more remote memory.'' Therefore that PL's role isn't to activate BLA fear circuit, but to recruit other parts othe network to do that.

TIME AND FEAR MEMORY PERFORMANCE
Cued fear memory is a somewhat unique form of memory, in that the magnitude of the behavioral response is stable over time. This suggests that the emotional arousal evoked by the fear stimulus remains stable from acquisition to remote memory.


Generalization is the loss of stimulus attributes associated with the original memory.


Incubation is how, sometimes, conditioned repsonse increases over time.
