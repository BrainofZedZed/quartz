# 1 Line
A strong review of the role of the auditory cortex (primary and association) in processing the salience and possibly valence of emotionally-associated auditory stimuli.

# Summary
It's established that auditory cortex encodes the identity of sounds, but whether it also encodes affective value of the sound is controversial.

Sacchetti group proposes that auditory cortex receives ascending affective (emotional-motivational) information related to sounds, uses that to encode valence, and then sends projections subcortically to motivate emotional behaviors

Behavioral salience is also represented in changes within the auditory cortex.

The content of the information encoded in auditory cortex plasticity is not well understood.

Studies in NHP (Brosch et al, 2005, 2011) show that auditory cortex firing both reflects size of reward obtained in response to tone, as well as a reward prediction error -- the mismatch between the delivered reward and the expected reward. These data indicate the auditory cortex encodes not only the identity and relevance of tones, but also the presence, content, and expectation of emotional stimuli associated with tones.

Long established that emotionally valenced tones cause changes to auditory cortex, but when only one valence is used, it can't be determined if the changes represent the valence itself (appeitive, aversive) or simply the importance (ie the existence of a valence itself)

Aversive stimuli by themselves, without tones, activates auditory cortex and triggers plasticity

Auditory cortex differentially encodes positive and negative valenced emotional stimuli linked to tones (Pi et al 2013, Grosso et al 2015)

evidence for emotional processing not just in temporal association cortex but in primary auditory cortex as well. But association cortex is primarily modulated by emotionally valenced sounds, and required for their recall, whereas primary is only partially

Letzkus 2011 demonstrated that ACh released from basal forebrain mediates the activation of auditory cortical neurons during tones paired with aversive stimuli in primary auditory cortex. Cambiaghi 2016 showed that nicotine administered into auditory association cortex prior to remote recall uniquely DISRUPTED aversive tone recall, but not appetitive tone recall or aversive odor recall. (would have expected the opposite)

#VTA #DA projects to auditory cortex, and VTA stimulation paired with tones enhances cortical representation to that tone (Bao et al, 2001). But unknown if DA links tone identity to an appetitive quality, or if it simply encodes salience regardless of meaning.

The auditory cortex receives diverse neuromodulatory projections, and these projections can alter sound processing within the auditory cortex. But it's difficult to determine if these projections help encode the valence identity of the sound, or simply just reflect salience

#BLA is recipricocally connected to auditory cortex. Primary auditory cortex receives most BLA afferents, while auditory association cortex sends most BLA efferents.

Yang 2016 show that lateral amygdala projections to the auditory cortex are required for full auditory fear association, and that they initiate an increase in spine density that persists for weeks

Model 1: auditory cortex encodes identity and overall salience of sound, relaying information to prefrontal and subcortical areas where valence identity is encoded.

Model 2: auditory cortex encodes identity, salience, and nature of salience (appetitive or aversive), then passes along to other cortical (eg prefrontal) and subcortical areas for further behavioral selection 
* in this model, affective encoding does not happen in prefrontal

If Model 2, inhibiting amygdala during acquisition would prevent auditory cortex from learning quality of association. Inhibiting amygdala during recall would impair freezing response mediated by amygdala.

Combining models would create a system in which the identity and nature of emotional stimulus is encoded at the amygdala, with additional valence and behavioral consequence information encoded in the cortex.
