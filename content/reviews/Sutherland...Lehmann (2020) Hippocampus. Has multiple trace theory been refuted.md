 Although much of the relevant literature in rodents can be viewed as supporting [[multiple trace theory]], specific tests of core predictions about the effects of partial and complete [[hippocampus]] damage, effects on context specific versus independent memories, and about expansion of HPC memory traces in physiological recording and IEG activation patterns have not yielded a consistent body of supporting evidence.
