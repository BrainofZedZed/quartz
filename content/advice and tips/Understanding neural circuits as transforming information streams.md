(inspired by talk from Vikhaas Sohal)
When thinking about a brain circuit, it's not enough to understand what it does to a specific behavior. You want to ask "what does this to do the information stream".
Each region is receiving information streams, integrating and transforming, then outputting. When dissecting circuits, think about what this does not just to the behavior but the information streams.
