from Three Questions to Address Rigour in your Proposal in Aug 2021 Nature

Addressing rigour in research proposals is often less about changing scientific choices or overall project design, and more about justifying how experimental-design choices address limitations that could prevent the researcher from answering their question or diminish the knowledge they derive from their experiment.

Our three-question framework guides writers to explain their experimental choices, by asking questions that address limitations in their proposal: 
1. What are the essential weaknesses or limitations in your science? Every scientific method has limits. Often, these limits are methodological or field-specific. 
2. 2. Which methods will you use, or are you already using, to address these limitations? These may be standard methods in your research group, but it’s important to highlight them as such for a reviewer. 
3. 3. What makes these methods adequate? Justify your choices by confirming how the field has tested or accepted these methods for overcoming limitations.

From: “We will use the stroke mouse model and treat the mice with our novel compound daily, for three weeks.”

To: "We will use the stroke model mouse, a model system we and others have shown to be relevant to understanding stroke outcomes (refs), to test the effect of novel therapeutic compounds."
