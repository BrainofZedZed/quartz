##### Chapter 8:  Grant Writing
- Grant writing cliche advice is real and true. Namely:
	- work with institutional officer as soon as you're thinking seriously about submitting something. Ask about what you need and what they can do for you
	- Finish writing and give it to the office 2 weeks ahead of time
	- Read the funding proposal -- every word, even if its boring
	- Read the funding agency's submission guidelines -- every word, even if its boring
	- If there's a workshop from the funding agency (or recorded sessions), watch/attend it
	- Discuss grant with grant coordinator at agency
	- Get recent examples of funded / unfunded grants
	- Get feedback

It isn't worth learning to write a singular grant. It is a skill and practice that takes time. It is worth it to learn to write many, many grants. 

Elephant or Seahorse
Different scholars have different grant styles -- few, precious grants, or many unprecious grants. Pick one style and stick to it.

Competing on the homefield
For every grant, there's three groups applying. The first are people who are studying that exact topic and are the experts. The second are people who have a direct link / tool to the topic. The third are people who, if you have the right twist to the grant, might be relevant. Always compete on your homefield and try to be in the first group.

Collaborate on grants

Don't spend too much time on grants. Remember the focus of scholarship -- research, not grants.
