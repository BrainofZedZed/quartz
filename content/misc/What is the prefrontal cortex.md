### factors for parcelling cortical areas
Four factors seem most influencial in parcelling out cortical areas and PFC inclusion (Van Essen and Glasser, 2018):
1. function
2. architecture
3. connectivity
4. topography


### canonical definition
The canonical definition of the mammalian [[PFC]] has traditionally been the projection field of the mediodorasl [[thalamus]] (Rose and Woolsey, 1948).

### connectomic studies
Harris et al (Nature, 2019) use corticocortical connectivity to define different cortical areas. This metric defines a prefrontal ensemble. 
Other connectivity studies:  
- Arhlund-Richter et al, 2019, Nat Neuro
- Zingg et al., 2014, Cell


### gene expression
Ortiz et al (2020, Sci Adv) did molecular profiling of the PFC but found continuous gene expression and did not find delineation between [[PFC]] regions. This is at odds with cytoarchitectural and connectomic studies.
