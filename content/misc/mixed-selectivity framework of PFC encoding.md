Conceptual frameworks for PFC function:  mixed-selectivity vs fixed functioning. Mixed-selectivity states that PFC neurons are selectively responsive to different parameters under different contexts -- that each context leads to specific neuronal tuning. Fixed functioning argues that PFC circuits and anatomy are diverse enough that neuronal tuning is diverse but fixed across contexts.
