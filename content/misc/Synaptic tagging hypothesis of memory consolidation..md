Short term potentiation at the synapse adds a synaptic tag at the synaptic level. Simultaneously, there is a retrograde signal from the synapse to the nucleus to induce cell-wide de novo protein synthesis. These de novo plasticity related proteins are sent throughout the cell, but need the synaptic tag to "catch" them and function. 

This process thereby combines synapse protein tagginb with cell-wide de novo protein synthesis to potentiate specific synapses.
