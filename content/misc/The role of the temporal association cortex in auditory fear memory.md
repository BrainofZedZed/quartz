[[Auditory association cortex (Te2) activity is driven by emotional learning]]. 

* Neurons in TeA are predominantly responsive to auditory stimuli only after they've been paired with emotional learning.
* This suggests that TeA either selectively represents auditory stimuli with affective qualities, or represents the affective qualities itself of the stimuli.

[[Temporal association cortex is required for early consolidation of remote auditory fear memory.]]

* demonstrates that even transient disruption of physiological TeA processes during consolidation interferes with remote (but not recent) memory.

[[Auditory cortex encodes salience -- and possibly valence -- of emotional stimuli.]]
