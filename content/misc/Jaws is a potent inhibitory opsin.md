[[Jaws photosensitivity]]

At 10 mW/mm2, Jaws' photocurrent (at tested expression levels) is ~600 pA, at 20 mW/mm2 it's around 750pA. HR3.0 carries that much current but with ~25% of the light power.

Also demonstrate that a ramp down from the light mitigates much of the rebound firing.  

Jaws for terminal inhibition was used in Benneyworth, Hearing...Thomas (2019) J Neuro. Otherwise widely used, but not often seen used for terminal inhibition.
