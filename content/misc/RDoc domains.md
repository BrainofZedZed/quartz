In contrast to disease-specific diagnostic criteria of the DSM, the NIH proposes Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of 5 domains or constructs of observable behavior and neurobiological measures that have common underlying neurobiological circuits. These domains defined so far include:
1. negative valence 
2. positive valence 
3. cognitive processes 
4. social processes 
5. arousal. 

 Each of these domains can consequently be analyzed on different levels, ranging from genes and molecules over cells and neural circuits up to physiology and behaviors.
