A behavioral analog to the [[Synaptic tagging hypothesis of memory consolidation.]]

A weak behavior tags the active synaptic ensemble, establishing short term memory. Without further intervention, the STM will fade. A subsequent novel experience will trigger de novo protein synthesis, strengthening the first weak experience ensemble, allowing it to persist into long term memory.
