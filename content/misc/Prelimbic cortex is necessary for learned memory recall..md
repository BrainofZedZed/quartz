Expression of both cued and contextual fear conditioning requires [[prelimbic]] cortex, both at recent (hours) and remote (weeks) timepoints.

>* Activation of [[prelimbic]] ensemble TRAPd during cued fear conditioning induces freezing with a time-dependent effect increase.
>* Inhibition of [[prelimbic]] ensemble TRAPd during remote (14d) but not recent (1d) recall of cued fear conditioning impairs freezing at very remote (28d) timepoint.  Had no effect on freezing in response to CS- or context
>* Inhibition of [[prelimbic]] cortex during cued fear conditioning learning does not prevent learning, but prevents PL neurons from participating in the fear memory ensemble
