Bao et al. (2001) found that the pairing of an auditory stimulus to the electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) increased the selectivity of the neural responses to that sound, in both Te1 and Te2. However, the authors wrote that ‘‘strong, sharply tuned responses to the paired tones also emerge in a second cortical area [Te2], whereas the same stimuli evoke only poor or non-selective responses in this second cortical ﬁeld in naive animals.’’ In other words, Te2 activity ‘‘becomes sharply and almost exclusively tuned to the paired stimulus frequency in VTAstimulated animals’’ whereas it was ‘‘poorly responsive to tonal stimuli and non-selective for tone frequency in naive animals’’
