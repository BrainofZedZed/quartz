Infusion of NMDA antagonist into [[basolateral amygdala]] blocks expression of fear memory -- both for recent (1d) and very remote (16 month) memory.

Animals were still able to freeze with NMDA antagonist on-board in response to overtraining on shocks, but recall of fear associations were blocked.
