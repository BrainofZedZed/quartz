* Secondary auditory cortex (aka [[temporal association cortex]]) lesion 1 month after auditory fear conditioning disrupts recall, but new learning is intact.
* Secondary visual cortex (aka [[lateral visual association cortex]]) lesion 1 month after visual fear conditioning disrupts recall, but not new learning.
	* but is it required for learning and then remote recall? 
		* could learning take place with other systems, but then recall is still contingent on association cortex?
