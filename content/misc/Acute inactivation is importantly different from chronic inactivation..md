The effects of lesion or permanent inactivation may not reveal all associated deficits of the affected area. Plasticity and compensatory mechanisms may come into play, such that the region's physiological function is subsumed elsewhere.

Many earlier lesion studies have suggested that [[Lesioning early sensory cortex fails to disrupt simple sensory behaviors]].

But other papers using reversible inactivation have suggested otherwise.

[[Dalmay...Letzkus (2019) Neuron. A critical role for neocortical processing of threat memory]] showed that acute inactivation of early auditory cortex impaired discrimination and learning of complex auditory stimuli (FM sweeps) but not simple stimuli (pure tones).

However, outside a fear learning paradigm, others have found 
[[Reversible inactivation of auditory cortex diminishes frequency discrimination]].

Beyond fear conditioning, this has been shown in hippocampal function as well. [[Acute inactivation of the hippocampus disrupts remote memory]]
