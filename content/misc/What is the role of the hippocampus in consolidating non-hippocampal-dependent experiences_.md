In standard [[systems consolidation]] theory of memory, [[hippocampus]] dependence is weaned away while the memory is transferred to the cortex.

But what about memories that don't require the hippocampus? For learning tasks that are hippocampal-independent, do they still rely on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples to generate reactivation events and consolidate memory?

It is known that consolidation and turnover of cortical memory ensembles occurs over time. What leads that process?

[[Sugden...Andermann (2020) Nature Neuroscience. Cortical reactivations of recent sensory experiences predict bidirectional network changes during learning]] shows that SWRs precede reactivation events in [[lateral visual association cortex]] on a task that is not (?) hippocampal dependent, suggesting that hippocampus still participates in consolidation. Shows evidence suggesting these reactivation events improve memory / task performance.

But [[Hippocampus is not required for consolidation or recall of cued fear memory.]] 

How to reconcile these?
