# Failures with contextual recall
>The decrease in hippocampal IEG expression in mPFC inhibited animals suggests an active and important role of [[PFC]] to hippocampus during learning and/or early consolidation, which goes opposite the general idea in [[systems consolidation]].

>Rats receiving NMDA-induced hippocampal lesions 1, 12, or 24 weeks after contextual fear conditioning display reduced freezing, with deficits correlating with lesion size. Thees findings support the idea that the hippocampus has a permanent role for contextual fear memory.

>Reactivation of [[hippocampus]](dentate gyrus) engram cells at remote timepoints drives freezing, indicating that the hippocampal engram is functional even after consolidation.
