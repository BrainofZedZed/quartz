[[Association cortex is required for recall of cued fear memory but not acquisition]]

Is the initial trace of a memory required in association cortex for development of remote recall? 

[[Sacco and Sacchetti (2010) Science. Role of secondary sensory cortices in emotional memory retrieval in rats]] showed that lesioning association cortex after learning disrupts remote memory but does not disrupt learning a new memory.

BUT it didn't address if that subsequent new memory, without the association cortex, is able to be recalled at remote timepoints.

Interesting to consider with the implications of [[systems consolidation]] and the 'cortical memory trace' proposed by [[Kitamura...Tonegawa (2017) Science. Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory]]
