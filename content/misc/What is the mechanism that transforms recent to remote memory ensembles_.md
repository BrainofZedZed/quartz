title: What is the mechanism that transforms recent to remote memory ensembles?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Over time, neocortical ensembles representing recent and [[remote memory]] change membership. There is clearly an ongoing consolidation process that happens over weeks to months. 

The mechanism behind that [[systems consolidation]] process is uncertain. It is likely linked to reactivation of the ensemble during resting periods. Maybe driven by [[hippocampus]] sharp-wave ripples. Perhaps it is PFC projections, like from [[prelimbic]] cortex, to those association cortices that instantiate the ensemble. 

I  can test the necessity of those projections over time by using persistent DREADD inhibition of specific PFC projections, and test if the remote memory still develops.
