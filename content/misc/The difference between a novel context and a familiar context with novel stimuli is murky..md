In the neuroscience literature, there is a delineation between 'context fear conditioning' and 'cued fear conditioning'. In reality, a context is an emergent property made up of multiple stimuli ie cues. 

It is unclear precisely how the brain determines whether a familiar space and novel stimuli are interpreted as such, or as a new context. Minimally, the [[hippocampus]] is involved.

[[Visual cue fear conditioning]] gets at this by using visual, tactile, and olfactory cues to differentiate contexts.
