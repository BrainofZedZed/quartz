Neuronal representations of learned tasks and events continually change over days and weeks, even after animals have achieved expert behavioral performance (including in [[DeNardo...Luo (2019) Nature Neuroscience. Temporal evolution of cortical ensembles promoting remote memory retrieval]]). 

This turnover is called representational drift.
