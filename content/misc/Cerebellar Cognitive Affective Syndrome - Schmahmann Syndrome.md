CCAS refers to a constellation of cognitive and affective phenotypes found in patients suffering specific cerebellar damage. The symptoms relate to executive, visuospatial, language, or affective domains

CCAS is based on the idea of 'dysmetria of thought'. As damage to the cerebellum can result in ataxia / dysmetria, so too can damage result in dysmetria of thought

[[Dysmetria of thought]] is based on two broad principles:  

1. the universal cerebellar transform (UCB)
2. the modular architecture of cerebellar-cortical connections

UCB is based on the principle that cerebellar architecture is essentially homogeneous, therefore any input into the cerebellar, regardless of domain, will be transformed in the same, universal way

The modular connectivity of cerebellar-cortical loops ensures the cerebellum receives information from various domains and outputs those transformations back toward those domains

If the cerebellum regulates thought in a similar way it regulates emotion, it then follows that if the cerebellum is damaged, the regulation of thought will be damaged as well
